1619282964.0,2021-04-24 12:49:24,2,52,Could someone explain to me like I was a 5 year old what are gas fees and when do they occur?
1619279044.0,2021-04-24 11:44:04,11,114,"Isn’t that why stellar, nano, lite coin and vertcoin etc were introducted? Mainly to mitigate the fees"
1619282160.0,2021-04-24 12:36:00,2,22,"Xlm is good, it’s fast too. I’ve been liking algo as well.   Pick tokens that’s not build on eth."
1619280024.0,2021-04-24 12:00:24,5,81,"ETH gas fees are actually dropping gradually while transactions are remaining high.  It’s not ideal, but it’s not as high as BTC either ($2.50 at the moment)  Edit: it’s $1.20 right now"
1619286595.0,2021-04-24 13:49:55,0,6,"I really hope not. Alt coins sure are after,  but Bitcoin sacrifices speed for  security. Ethereum  has such a extensive ecosystem that their downfall would only be possible  if they ran into major major security issues."
1619307585.0,2021-04-24 19:39:45,1,5,Algo has the best overall package right now .
1619290280.0,2021-04-24 14:51:20,2,12,> I sent a transaction with BTC and it costed me $60.  How is that ?  were you using segwit ?  did it have more than 5 or 10 outputs and inputs ?  even at the peak next block transactions were only 20$
1619280309.0,2021-04-24 12:05:09,3,50,At the moment the gas fee of eth is very low...
1619284338.0,2021-04-24 13:12:18,0,5,What BTC adress did you use? Didnt cost me 60usd to send BTC lol
1619287815.0,2021-04-24 14:10:15,0,4,"The Bitcoin fees are perfectly fine right now. 50 sat/byte gets you in the next block. That will probably be less than 2 dollars.  [https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,fee](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,fee)"
1619290508.0,2021-04-24 14:55:08,0,5,"if only there were projects that could scale and have low fees....oh wait, they already exist."
1619292635.0,2021-04-24 15:30:35,1,4,You say ETH is unusable when fees are the lowest they have been in months
1619279046.0,2021-04-24 11:44:06,2,28,Well at least ETH had a solution coming.
1619283094.0,2021-04-24 12:51:34,4,36,"This narrative is so tired. ETH already scales right now, ETH 2 launched 4 months ago, you're just choosing to send transactions and use applications directly on layer 1.  Here's a transaction of Eth from 1 minute ago, it cost $2.83: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8838e6df1ea61349f49bd5c69a551c3ebe4ab0c1266bb8fab0dfc6b22f93f0fe  Still expensive, but a far cry from being unusable."
1619283260.0,2021-04-24 12:54:20,2,20,Computers were pretty expensive at first too. Only rich people and universities could afford them. This seems to be true for a lot of new technologies.
1619279067.0,2021-04-24 11:44:27,1,10,They’re a store of value and not a great way to do p2p.

1619279150.0,2021-04-24 11:45:50,3,11,"Well use a lower fee crypto for transfers ie LTC, XLM, XMR ect. ETH gas fee was like $3 last night. You gotta wait bro"
1619279845.0,2021-04-24 11:57:25,0,7,"Fake, ETH fee, I've been wanting to put an NFT on opensea but damn, just on eth gas fees is like $70 come on now, I know for some people out there ain't much but for most of the people that way to much , so ridiculously...."
1619286521.0,2021-04-24 13:48:41,1,4,"ETH fees are the lowest they've been all year, and you're complaining now?"
1619283332.0,2021-04-24 12:55:32,1,6,"Bitcoin fees are coming down quickly, and the difficulty adjustment is coming up. You could have just waited for lower fees, since it was a guarantee they were coming.  Also, Lightning works, now, today. Go try it. I recommend Breez wallet, Muun wallet, and Phoenix wallet."
1619281555.0,2021-04-24 12:25:55,1,7,"Just use XLM, like the rest of us"
1619287314.0,2021-04-24 14:01:54,0,2,/r/btc will love this post.
1619296289.0,2021-04-24 16:31:29,1,2,"Right now you have to pay a premium for using decentralized technology. It sucks, but ultimately these technologies were designed for decentralization NOT eliminating fees. Hopefully it gets better in the future and there's an option that's both decentralized and low fee.  It's like the early days of the internet, where you had to pay by the minute for a crappy 56k connection. You're paying a premium to use burgeoning technology."
1619296743.0,2021-04-24 16:39:03,0,2,"Yes, yes, yes, but IOTA. Fees just doesn't make any sense."
1619297816.0,2021-04-24 16:56:56,0,2,Lightning is already here.... I use it with Bitrefill to buy daily stuff in a freakin third world country at 1-3 sats fees.
1619301590.0,2021-04-24 17:59:50,0,2,"With properly decentralized crypto, it is not possible to scale on base layer. Bitcoin is the most decentralized crypto currency.  Crypto currencies have 3 properties: Decentralization, security, and speed. If you want to increase the speed on base layer you would need to compromise with decentralization and security. This is the reason Bitcoin doesn’t want to make any modifications in the base layer for scaling.   The reason Lightning Network is not yet widely adopted is because no one wants to use their Bitcoin to buy a coffee.  Any money starts as a store of value (currently where Bitcoin is at), then a medium of exchange (already happening for larger transactions on base layer, smaller transactions with Lightning), and then an unit of account ( takes time for adoption but some companies like Tesla already accepting Bitcoin as a payment)."
1619282127.0,2021-04-24 12:35:27,0,4,"Really? I used Ethereum all morning, it worked great."
1619283330.0,2021-04-24 12:55:30,1,5,This is why I hold on to my very few nanos. It solves these problems of btc and other crypto as a currency.
1619283522.0,2021-04-24 12:58:42,2,6,I really don't get this. It cost me £2.50 for eth transaction coinbase to wallet this morning.
1619286103.0,2021-04-24 13:41:43,4,8,"This is exactly why I don't own a single BTC or ETH, I don't believe in them for the very long term. and so far ADA, XRP, etc have made me more profits too."
1619286205.0,2021-04-24 13:43:25,0,3,Have you ever heard of $NANO? Instant transactions with no fees. Check it out. Imagine paying fees per transaction.
1619283563.0,2021-04-24 12:59:23,0,3,Let the shit-coin shilling in comments commence.
1619295655.0,2021-04-24 16:20:55,0,2,\>eth 2.0  When's half life 3 coming out again?
1619288452.0,2021-04-24 14:20:52,0,2,"You can always use XRP, great coin, fast transactions and low fees"
1619289073.0,2021-04-24 14:31:13,0,2,Maybe try Feeless Coins like IOTA or NANO?
1619287076.0,2021-04-24 13:57:56,0,1,Thats why you need to move to LTC I think. Its a top 10 coin with faster and cheaper everything.
1619289131.0,2021-04-24 14:32:11,1,1,Man does anyone know about IOTA. I feel like im taking crazy pills. (Zoolander reference)
1619301939.0,2021-04-24 18:05:39,0,1,Doge coin is coming

1619279176.0,2021-04-24 11:46:16,3,-4,BTC is like the gold of the crypto currency as it was the first crypto to be used. Other than that it is SHIT crypto.  ETH is like the silver plus it has some functionality but failed in the transaction fees as a gas.  My point of view is that there is some crypto out there that can smash and destroy these two cryptos by their much more advanced technology and its speed!!
1619282600.0,2021-04-24 12:43:20,0,1,"BTC has great brand value if anything. ETH, in my opinion, has a great team/organization pushing the envelope of what a cryptocurrency should be. Neither are at their end state and both could crash spectacularly."
1619284311.0,2021-04-24 13:11:51,1,1,Try to use some L2 solutions like loopring to send and receive money.  Still wonders me that people don’t use them more often
1619285411.0,2021-04-24 13:30:11,0,1,Maybe we'd be better off using DOGE as gas.
1619286585.0,2021-04-24 13:49:45,1,1,"BTC and ETH are just the big ones everybody knows, but I don't see them being the future in the long-term.  They're serving their purpose, but we need faster and cheaper transactions which use less hardware resources.  Try running an Ethereum node and see how much CPU and RAM it takes.  You can run Bitcoin Core and even a CPU miner active on a few cores and have a more usable machine.  I love what Ethereum is but I think it's growing far too quickly to sustain what it's become.  As for transaction fees, it's still cheaper to convert to something like Litecoin, transfer that, and convert it back."
1619287142.0,2021-04-24 13:59:02,1,1,"Transact with ETH and BTC is a painfull experience that I always try to avoid.  They were the firsts, but they are outdated."
1619296560.0,2021-04-24 16:36:00,0,1,"Yeah I started moving my money into better built blockchain tech like Cardano, Polkadot, Stellar, and Algorand. I just don’t feel good about ETH. BTC on the other hand has a much more limited supply and wider adoption so I look at it as a store of value, nothing more."
1619301787.0,2021-04-24 18:03:07,0,1,"At the risk of being crucified by everyone here, I think Doge solves that exact problem."

1619285158.0,2021-04-24 13:25:58,1,0,"""I'm heavily invested in other coins so I hope BTC and ETH drop so mine go up""     Cool story bro"
1619288612.0,2021-04-24 14:23:32,1,0,I moved 300 USD of crypto between three exchanges yesterday for a total of 2 USD in network fees with... dogecoin
1619279104.0,2021-04-24 11:45:04,0,1,"I agree with your point, but atm I don't know which protocol is better, or whether it being better in one sense or another even matters when it comes to what people will end up using."
1619279335.0,2021-04-24 11:48:55,0,1,I had a transaction go through last night for 0.000316 btc. As long as you have some patience you can get away with lower fees although it’s still pretty high compared to other cryptos.
1619281248.0,2021-04-24 12:20:48,0,1,"I think it’s widely accepted btc as a currency is not ideal, albeit lightning helps and eth is a bit of a victim of its own success. The reaction to defi has been far greater than the network can cope with, but its going in the right direction."
1619281919.0,2021-04-24 12:31:59,0,1,"I’m genuinely curious what people think of Decred as a possibly upgraded version of BTC. The proof of stake consensus should help to lower fees and costs of mining and keep mining from being taken over by big companies. Also, stakeholders vote on the project and its direction. I do hold and will always hold BTC though. Just looking at other investments"
1619283266.0,2021-04-24 12:54:26,0,1,"Yeah, all that BTC and ETH collected at the dip have to sit at the exchange for quite some time."
1619287155.0,2021-04-24 13:59:15,0,1,"To be fair, Ethereum is a massive network with many coins that have different uses. Don’t like ETH? Trade one of the other dozens of coins on the network. Unlike Bitcoin, you invest in ETH for the network and the technology behind it."
1619287187.0,2021-04-24 13:59:47,0,1,"I usually trade it into EOS which costs less than a dollar to send. It's fast too. When it arrives to the exchange, I trade EOS into BTC/USDT and probably don't lose (I' might even make a small profit) as much as the BTC/ETH transaction fee would have been."
1619287226.0,2021-04-24 14:00:26,0,1,This is why the gravity bridge and Bitcoin bridge for the cosmos network is going to be such a great tool for our entire ecosystem. Bitcoin is always king and Eth is one of the most important projects in our space. The IBC will change this.

1619288531.0,2021-04-24 14:22:11,1,1,"The fastest way of sending 30$ of btc would cost me 31$. Thank you exodus, but I'll stick to waiting five days for my transaction to process."
1619290562.0,2021-04-24 14:56:02,0,1,"ITT: full blown, pants down, dicks out Tribalism"
1619291350.0,2021-04-24 15:09:10,0,1,Was anybody buying crypto so that they could use it? No it’s a store of value that is somewhat protected from inflation which we are about to see
1619292956.0,2021-04-24 15:35:56,0,1,"Facts. I do not want to further invest in them. Especially Bitcoin has become nothing but a normal paper. You invest to make money, not because you REALLY wanna buy stuff with it. *BRUH*"
1619293386.0,2021-04-24 15:43:06,0,1,Stellar would be your answers probably I do think this is just due to how early we all are btc and eth still have a lot of growing to do
1619293632.0,2021-04-24 15:47:12,0,1,"You still live in the past brother! **ETHEREUM Layer 2 is already LIVE**, what are you whining about?  You can use 10 dollar for the fee to send all your Eth to e.g. **Polygon/Matic** and enjoy transactionspeeds at 2-3 second that cost like less than 0,1 cent.  Don't believe me? Check for yourself :)"
1619294277.0,2021-04-24 15:57:57,1,1,exactly. both are nice to have but I couldn't buy anything with them unless I loose alot through the transfer. I have high hopes for Eth2.0 to eliminate this problem. I love to buy and hodl these coins but it wouldn't be bad to actually be able to buy something with them.
1619295109.0,2021-04-24 16:11:49,0,1,Say hi to litecoin
1619296122.0,2021-04-24 16:28:42,0,1,the next biggest thing will build on btc making it cheap and scalable. might even be eth but doesnt look like it

1619296874.0,2021-04-24 16:41:14,0,1,Well I moved my ETH to the Conflux Network in order to avoid the crazy fees
1619297072.0,2021-04-24 16:44:32,0,1,"I want to continue buying ETH weekly to dollar cost average but its too expensive to buy and transfer from exchange to wallet so I haven't bought any ETH in the last few weeks, this is for sure holding back new ATH's as many average investors are surely in the same boat."
1619297711.0,2021-04-24 16:55:11,0,1,"Agreed. I like the defi cases of eth buy it is literally unusable. I'd taken out oasis loans in the past and wanted to pay them off. 1. Swap one of my shitcoins for Dai - stung with $60 eth fee. 2. Swap another shitcoin for Dai - another$60 fee. 3. Go on oasis, another $60 to allow oassis to use dai. 4. Another fee to actually pay the loan off. 5 another fee to withdraw my crypto out of oasis. Paying $100's dollars for simple tasks  Wtf"
1619297891.0,2021-04-24 16:58:11,0,1,"Ethereum just raised the gas fee and we are starting to go through the transaction backlog.  $1 is still too much for a transaction fee imo, but the gas limit increase should provide some relief and another gas limit increase could come into play in the coming months if needed  Layer 2 solutions are also here now and more per.anant relief is coming soon.  You are still early. There are still growing pains, but its being worked on.  https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#ETH,4d,weight"

People say it’s like gold but gold is a precious metal, limited by the earth and not made by man. Bitcoin was made by man; improvements can be made and predecessors can take over the market share. Whereas gold is an element."
1619300006.0,2021-04-24 17:33:26,0,1,I receive BTC from Europe and find the speed and cost to be a lot better than waiting for a check or dealing with my bank shutting off my account when there’s foreign transactions. It has lots of cross nation applications rn cheaper and quicker than Western Union. One benefit.

However you shouldn’t be moving around BTC in the first place. You could convert it to a cheaper coin, move that coin and then turn it back into BTC for a fraction of the cost of moving BTC. Your knowledge on fees needs to be worked on my friend. Buying and holding them for their value is a solid move. ETH is hopefully upgrading their system and finding ways to lower those fees for moving its coins."

For example you can use exchanges like Gemini which provide free withdrawals or other exchanges which have low withdrawal fees.  Are you using a wallet that supports Native Segwit addresses? Those usually give you cheaper fees also.

To transfer around exchanges I've been using XLM for the speed.  That bloat in fees though is built into the algorithm, as the mining rewards are reduced by the minting of new coins, the difference is supposed to be made up by the TX fees.  The time it takes to mine is also directly related to difficulty, this was all pointed out in the dark ages of crypto in discussions and the can was kicked down the road  Also anyone who has been in eth like me, since the testnet, remembers them talking about POS. It's been the miners boogeyman for the last half decade.  I remember when ZEC came out and was supposed to be the new thing, lightning fast TX, with the privacy of monero, where no one could track your blockchain habits. (Like xmr) and we see how that turned out. I haven't seen zec anywhere in awhile.  LTC was the back in the day, lightning chain compared to btc but even that has fallen down.  I'm digging these smart chain coins on BNB. It reminds me of the early days of eth, does anyone remember the dragons thst you could grow and have battle? Omg I would be a millionaire with the eth I spent.  but there's way more money in crypto now. Scams are rampant, and going into trust wallet and pancake swap make me feel like I walked into the casino, and that's how I explain bnb to non crypto people.  Aside from mining eth. I don't think I'll use it anymore. I had genuinely hoped with smart contracts and Dapps thst it could be used to facilitate real estate transactions and displace escrow. And thst we could move house ownership and taxes etc, into blockchain,  but I think the many problems inherent in these algorithms is why that will never be   Whats really needed is a cross-crypto ledger algorithm with no difficulty increase between blocks and the reward tied to be just a little higher than power consumption. One coin to rule them all so to speak. That spits confirmed tx out to the various chains."

MATIC for example is a great L2 solution to ETH but the devs still have backdoors into every smart contract and full decentralization of the DAO has not been achieved yet. (might be out of date but this was true in Nov 2020). Its also hard to trust these new DEXs and other dapps on all the altchains as well, since their gov tokens are not well disbursed and so very few actors hold huge %s of the voting power.  If you are going to put 5-6 figures into defi then ETH is way safer.  BTC is the same way, its been around for over a decade and the governance of it has been very consistent and the community is strong. cant find another coin that has the same claim."

Even when cardano gets hot sexy dapps, its going to be miles behind ETH in terms of maturity of the ecosystem.

The resolution also encourages the state and local governments to consider ways that could help them benefit from the increased use of this new technology.

You aren't mining bitcoin by using your own brain to perform the equations. You mine bitcoin by buying shitloads of Asic miners to do it. And those things are not cheap.  >pos- you can just sit on a pile of money and stay rich forever(in that coin)...dumb people can get richer and richer(in that coin)  The benefits of PoS is allowing your crypto***currency*** to actually be used as a currency. It also has the benefit of becoming more decentralized over time as whales sell off and take profits. Bitcoin and Ethereum currently have most of their hash rate coming from China because of the cheap electricity which is not a good thing. Neither have anything to do with intelligence, that's probably the stupidest argument I think I have ever heard.  >bitcoin is a push mechanism so eventually everyone will learn not to seperate themselves from their keys so that means if you spend your bitcoin on dumb things like junk over quality you will lose your bitcoins fast unless your smart and can earn more bitcoin to replace what u spend  I'm sorry, this is actually the dumbest argument I think I have ever heard.  >with pos you just have to sit on a pile of coins and then you will get more and more coins  Yes, proof of stake means if you want more you have to lock your funds up and can't withdraw immediately preventing whales from panic selling all at the same time. Sounds like a pretty good mechanism to me. If you want more ethereum you have to actually put your money where your mouth is and believe in the project enough to lock up your funds.  >you dont need to earn or think of a way to make more coins cuz the system just hands more coins to you  You don't need to think of a way to earn more bitcoin either, you jist gotta buy more asic miners. This isn't rocket science here.  Also  >https://medium.com/@Conner_/bitcoin-the-blockchain-for-truly-smart-contracts-f7100b73da01  Lol, I love when bitcoin maximalists point to the lightning network as the fix for everything.

The only rich people who even really benefit are people building military tech, and that's just a drawback of living in a capitalist society.

And there have been signs that buying pressure is down, too. So people aren't selling but also aren't buying anymore. I guess that most of the big institutional money did their buying and paused it when we got solidly over $50k. So it's kind of a stalemate. But $100k this cycle has been a meme for a long time, and it seemed like everyone expected it to happen - most people saw that as on the low end of estimates for the peak. But it also seems like alt season already happened and the btc price just leveled off. IDK what to think. I'm hoping some good news triggers a buying spree this summer.

The peaks of Feb 21,  March 14 and April 14 are all very close to each other and they get closer every peak.  Furthermore, the current low from our last peak is lower than the low of march 25.  It's only the first major bear sign yet though, so it could easily reverse and it usually takes several of these type of signs to truly assess the situation more accurately, but it's time to be cautious and start strategically planning a partial exit on next run up if you want to play it safe.

Both recent draw downs in BTC correspond to two spikes in leveraged longs getting liquidated. The first was over $9Billion and the second was over $3B.  This is healthy because it got rid of a lot of leverage that greedy knuckleheads were using.   The other graph that I find comforting is Willy Woo's HODL Waves chart:  [http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-hodl-waves-active/](http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-hodl-waves-active/)  It shows that no one that's been holding for more than 180 days is selling.

This sub always seems to question if it's a bear market suddenly once they see one to two weeks of red candles in spite of being up for the year significantly more than basically any other investment class ever.   The media spent a decade telling us hundreds of times bitcoin was dead, and it did the exact opposite to be the best performing asset of the decade if not all time.   This pullback is good, it's normal, its healthy. Nothing has changed except bitcoin rose a little too high, too fast, and it is cooling off before it goes even higher, maybe a little faster, and repeats that a few more times until it finally goes way too high, way too fast, and then crashes for the next crypto winter."

Stock to flow put 2017 bitcoin around maybe a little less than 10k, and it hit 20k, double that before crashing.   Stock to flow also does not account Fiat inflation into its model or the pandemic digital economy, the state of both have highly favor increased cryptocurrency demand.   So factor in base valuation of 100k, add (I would say at least) another 50k on top due to the above factors which are greatly increasing bitcoin demand (this is a supply and demand model after all), that gives you 150k. Now consider we get overextended twice the true value at the peak of each bullrun, and that's how a 300k bitcoin peak is actually not illogical."

My plan has been to accumulate alt-coins during the dips of this bull market and DCA out of most of my positions toward the end of the year (probably about 70% between August and November) and use my earnings to reinvest once the bear market comes around again.     My reasoning for starting this way is to take on a bit more risk for higher potential gains throughout the bull cycle. I think it's fairly undeniable that BTC is the safest hedge against inflation as a store of value, but I'm really looking to profit as much as possible from the bull run.     Once the bear market comes back to town, I'm gonna be DCAing back into my most bullish alts (for me: ADA, VET, BNB, and some ETH) alongside BTC which I'd like to eventually have 25% of my crypto portfolio in.   Now, the PROBLEM with this strategy is that it is a giant F if we don't see the normal 4 year cycle repeat itself. If we see BTC hit something like 150k at the end of the year and not drop down 70-90% in the following months then this strategy could make it difficult to grab back my positions. However, there will always be dips and history tends to rhyme so this feels like the safest strategy for me. (:"

1619285143.0,2021-04-24 13:25:43,3,4,Not op but I also have no ETH. My reasoning is that high fees are killing the ecosystem slowly. People don't care whether something is decentralised and it seems PancakeSwap is getting a lot of attention right now. Proof of stake and lower fees have been in the works for what seems like forever and I personally can't see how they will marry utility with high ETH price. So I think ETH could become a store of value and the token price will increase or utility and the token price will decrease. I can't see how they can have both. Disclaimer: OP asked so I answered. It's my opinion and yours can be different.
1619289419.0,2021-04-24 14:36:59,1,3,Also hold bitcoin but no eth.  It's the gas.  I don't buy in large chunks. I DCA with small weekly investmens. I don't want to lose a significant percentage of my purchase every week just transfering it to a hardware wallet.    Same reason I don't use many protocol services...

1619286392.0,2021-04-24 13:46:32,0,2,"Sure, that’s really what it is. I do love Bitcoin and what it did to disrupt the legacy financial system. Bitcoin is certainly not shit and has performed well as one of the best assets to own for over a decade. It’s taking on its role as a digital gold very well. But depending on someone’s risk profile, a digital gold might not be the best investment for them during a certain time frame. I mean we all invest to reap the profits, no shame in acknowledging that.  Edit: I think someone can also believe in better tech as well. Better tech = better product = better long term profit isn’t a terribly faulty logic."

As for your 5000% comment, it has some truth there sure but not sure why that would bother you, people want to make money when investing, that should not surprise or bother you, if they think that is somewhere other than BTC that is up to them.  If nobody put money into potential futures and just stuck with the ""tried and tested"" we would not have gotten the many startup companies that have developed into something and given us many great products."

1619301663.0,2021-04-24 18:01:03,1,-1,It means there are more open sell orders than open buy orders.  It's an indicator that the asset is undervalued.
1619302342.0,2021-04-24 18:12:22,1,1,"The RSI (Relative Strength Index)  Essentially measures the average of all the ups and the average of all the downs. It takes those two numbers and than divides them by each other in a more complex calculation.   What you need to know is that a 50RSI means that every Up and every Down is equal to each other. Anything above 50 means that the Ups are longer than the Downs. And below 50 means the Downs are longer.    At 70 they're considered ""Overbought""   At 30 they're considered ""Oversold""   What that means is that the trend is proportionally one way or the other. It doesn't confirm trend reversal as Overbought and Oversold are kindof a play on words, an extreme rise can hit 100 and just keep going and going for days. It means the Ups are much larger than the Downs.   Knowing this about RSI, it can be an amazing tool to read what could potentially happen next.  (I like to read Volume alongside RSI and confirm that with the Bollinger Bands and Moving Averages)"
1619302806.0,2021-04-24 18:20:06,1,4,It does not mean that. That's what I thought at first but I've spent weeks learning what it really means. It's made my trading a lot better as I now know that you can hit 15 or less and still keep slipping further down easily.
1619302502.0,2021-04-24 18:15:02,1,2,When you say ups are longer or downs are longer do you mean time wise? Like it's has spent more time in an uptrend than a downtrend or vice versa??

Another way to use RSI is that after a major trend, you can know the trend is over when the RSI returns to the 50 area. It means you've been bouncing up and down equally to the point where you're flat lining and the next trend is about to begin."

So depending upon which of these exchanges has more volume, these quotes may be more or less reliable.  None of them are the “truth”, they’re all estimates.

It's the simplest of the cryptos; you know exactly what product you will have in the next 3 years (very long time in crypto lmao) if you choose to invest $20M in Bitcoin today. Protocol changes means power struggles and governance problems, and those are never a good thing for financial stability."

It's scary for institutions to get into crypto and scarier still if the crypto is undergoing rapid development.  Bitcoin's selling point is that it's the oldest and accordingly has the most proven record.  12 years is not a long time for an asset--it only seems like a long time to crypto investors.  To get from 1 trillion market cap to, say, 5 trillion, the target audience changes to the institutions and Bitcoin has the best chance of capturing their attention.  Also difficulty of mining turns out to be a feature, not a bug, when viewed in this context.  Remember that all the electricity needed to mine is also the electricity requirements to undermine bitcoin.  In other words, it's an investment in the stability of the system.  Again, a feature from an institutional perspective."

""Best tech deserves to win"" kind of thing.  And I think in the long run, that may well be true, but whether you're an Ethereum maximalist, or Cardano, or whatever, you should be rooting for Bitcoin, because we need it to succeed.  The bridges it's building to hedgefunds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, etc. are bridges that all these other projects will travel over IF Bitcoin succeeds.    One other note:  from the perspective of institutional investment the transaction costs for Bitcoin are completely negligible (almost shockingly so).  When you're spending $25 million plus on a transaction, you're used to the transaction costs being many orders of magnitude larger than they are for bitcoin.  Again, if we go back to the three ""negatives"" from OP, all three are positives from an institutional perspective:  (1) near-non-existent transaction costs; (2) difficulty of mining / stability of system; (3) no special features (i.e., consistency as an investment)."

If we had 12 servers… and we were trusting those 12 servers to protect $200 billion I would think that’s much riskier.

1619304316.0,2021-04-24 18:45:16,1,11,Bitcoin has been spear-heading the market and we've seen this ebb and flows in Bitcoin dominance before. The [flippening](https://www.flippening.watch/) might happen but I don't think it will be anytime soon.
1619305617.0,2021-04-24 19:06:57,0,3,Where can I buy myself some of this 'Etherum'?? Sounds like the real deal 🤯
1619304537.0,2021-04-24 18:48:57,0,5,"Bitcoin dominance has always fell in the midst of a bull run, commonly referred to as *Alt-season*. It even fell to 30% in 2018. It’s actually falling at a slower pace now than it did in prior years. Bitcoin also has a much wider lead against Ethereum now than it did in 2018.  There’s no basis yet to think Bitcoin will get permanently flipped unless you just feel like *this time is different.*"
1619304519.0,2021-04-24 18:48:39,0,4,"Yes but do not take the lower dominance now for granted, in a potential bear market it might even return to 70%, as many altcoins will get dumped a lot. Still, I think that ETH will flip BTC in a few years, assuming ETH 2.0 and all the other updates go fine and in time."
1619305812.0,2021-04-24 19:10:12,0,2,This same “flippening” happened in 2017. Bitcoin lost dominance with 40% and alts getting 60%.

1619304979.0,2021-04-24 18:56:19,0,2,"Bitcoin, whilst perfect in its own way, will eventually fall for a digital asset with function beyond value and one which is less power hungry (proof of stake).   The Flippening as we know begins with decoupling. We have seen clear and increasing signs of this in the last few months.   From there the fall of bitcoin dominance is inevitable.   As the market cap of bitcoin increases, its potential for huge gains decreases. The market cap is limited by how many people want to risk their money on such a speculative asset. No one holds bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, there are better, less risky assets for that.   Bitcoin whales will realise the possibilities of very large gains are possible only if they move their Bitcoin to Ether.  This will cause a chain reaction where bitcoin holders panic sell and plough their assets into ETHER. The flippening, when it begins in earnest, won’t be slow and steady, but frighteningly fast."
1619305127.0,2021-04-24 18:58:47,1,2,In my opinion Bitcoin will still be nr1 for at least this whole bull run but by the next one (2024-2025 if I'm not mistaken) I think ETH or even a dark horse like ADA can overtake it.

1619310641.0,2021-04-24 20:30:41,1,4,"My theory is that it goes all the way back to the Tether settlement with the SEC. They started printing tethers because they knew the end was near and converting the Tethers to BTC. During that period Tether would drop 1 or 2 cents and quickly be buoyed by Chinese money who buy the dip. A lot of leverage traders got positions in to hold the price at $58k, and then the Coinbase IPO happened and the price started pumping the week before in anticipation of that. Similarly leverage traders started opening up positions. After the COIN IPO all the insiders dumped their shares, causing Coinbase to fall which spooked BTC holders and caused all those long positions to liquidate. The only thing buoying the price now is Microstrategy’s huge buys in the $50’s. They’ve created a floor that can’t be liquidated. So once the leverage traders are done licking their wounds the pump will start back up. I think the Chinese mining blackout was a coincidence."

1619294701.0,2021-04-24 16:05:01,1,2,Transaction fees were absurdly high for BTC last week. So that’s probably what it was.
1619294882.0,2021-04-24 16:08:02,1,2,I've used crypto.com to pay for daily purchases. It is easy to top up the crypto.com Visa card with crypto or fiat and pay anywhere they accept Visa while getting some crypto as cashback. Usually I prefer to spend fiat though and hold on to my crypto assets.
1619295959.0,2021-04-24 16:25:59,1,2,"Neither BTC or ETH are general payment options at this point because of high fees.  For an expensive purchase sure, but for a coffee it isn’t worth it"

1619294721.0,2021-04-24 16:05:21,0,1,"Basically any other cryptocurrency is going to have less fees than bitcoin, both because bitcoin has the highest cost right now, and a lot of transactions. Lightning network is supposed to help solve this, but it has yet to reach mass adoption.  If they accept any other cryptocurrencies I would use those to transact.  You can find out the average fee for other cryptocurrencies by searching ""ethereum/litecoin/bitcoin cash/etc average transaction fee"" -- these are determined by the price of the coin, and how many transactions are processed on that network compared to it's capacity."

1619237361.0,2021-04-24 00:09:21,1,13,Most BTC holders don't give a shit about the lightening network
1619233543.0,2021-04-23 23:05:43,0,6,Until we can coexist this market will be as volatile as ever.
1619256029.0,2021-04-24 05:20:29,1,5,"    You have some misconceptions about lightening.  You do not open individual lightning channels to each shop.    You connect to node of your liking (preferably a hub, with many connections).      You can now route your payments over this node to any other node it is directly, or indirectly connected.      You do not (ever) close your channel, unless you have to.    (My oldest lightning channel is open for over a year)      I normally donate to Johoe's Bitcoin Mempool Statistics about a 1 dollar a week.    And buy some steam or play store credit with it from bitrefill.      I hope that Kraken finishes its lightning integration before my channels run empty.    With this I could top up my channel without any on chain transaction"
1619238785.0,2021-04-24 00:33:05,1,10,"I thought the main use case for the lightning network was for a store or business to open one up and then multiple people can interact with it to do faster/cheaper transactions, then they close it at the end of the day and write to the chain. I might be misunderstanding it though. But yeah, there are definitely better solutions for singular transactions."
1619253185.0,2021-04-24 04:33:05,0,3,Bitcoin is still gold because it’s the least riskiest coin of all available coin out there.

1619244471.0,2021-04-24 02:07:51,2,5,"I may be misunderstanding,  but aren't coins like litecoin only cheap for transactions because they aren't as popular as bitcoin so the traffic isnt as high? And for like bch and (possibly, its been a while) bsv since they expanded the block size for more transactions would that make them less of a store of value and more of a medium of exchange?  Im not trying to ""disprove"" anyone or say that I'm right, im just wondering."
1619232567.0,2021-04-23 22:49:27,3,12,Try to post this in r/bitcoin
1619232625.0,2021-04-23 22:50:25,4,12,"Came here to hear your criticism of lightning, but your post really does not address it at all."
1619277238.0,2021-04-24 11:13:58,0,2,"Funny you mention Lightning, I recently asked the Cardano community about how they are going to attract DeFi with their slow-ass 1st layer and the answer seems to be ""our second layer can scale to a million tps by adding nodes!"" and that's not really working for BTC or ETH  I bring this up because not all altcoins and blockchains are created equal.  Not every altcoin fixes this, including everyone's #2 darling"
1619249045.0,2021-04-24 03:24:05,1,4,"What about security? The reason btc not having high txps is cuz it has to be slow for the most security. Sure we could just increase the blocksize of btc but with less secure.  How about altcoins? I dont think onchain speed is adoptable and to keep security. You heard about the blockchain trilemma?  Also, Lightning can get developed aswell like the altcoins. Look at ETH, so hyped but totally useless atm. U cant swap your Investments cuz of the gas fees. You are prisoned in this blokchain without any chance to get out from it until they finally fix their shit. Cardano doesnt have some features yet but will soon. And even Lightning hasnt the features yet which are possible.   No one can predict the future, but Bitcoin is most adopted and most people dont care much (see doge pump) about facts n stuff. Most ppl will just use bitcoin cuz everyone uses it. Thats why we still using whatsapp, Twitch, YouTube when there are way better solutions with more privacy etc. People dont care. The bubble cares, but the average human out there absolutely dont care and just want more cash."
1619239588.0,2021-04-24 00:46:28,0,3,I can see why you hold your position and in some ways you are right but you're ignoring the pace of change and when these developments will see mass adoption. Big adopters like Michael Saylor are not suggesting that BTC will be the only layer of currency. He's saying it will be a base layer with fiat rails on top (USD and EURO for the most part) because that is realistic. This way the global financial system is underpinned by something much more robust economically than a fiat currency and it's no longer a single nations currency.   Be realistic. Why would the majority of people use Litecoin for transacting instead of a digital fiat on top of BTC? They won't. It's better this way because the developed nations with more powerful currency who would otherwise see crypto as an unacceptable force could benefit from it instead. Poorer countries with weak currencies like Venezuela would cease to have one and their people would be much better off.   The problems you are describing are real but the solution you are proposing is not a likely one and nothing is going to replace Bitcoin anytime soon.
1619234808.0,2021-04-23 23:26:48,0,3,"Post is a little misleading.   I do not think anyone argues that BTC will not be for everyday transaction. Perhaps years ago?  It is seen largely as a store of value as you mention. In the coming years it will gravitate to a particular price, become less volatile, etc. and continue to be a store of value. It may also be used for large purchases that make the fees negligible and instant verification is not required. Things like backing a line of credit also.  Other coins besides BTC will also further develop, blockchain technology in general is not going anywhere. There are endless use cases."
1619247790.0,2021-04-24 03:03:10,1,3,"and alts provide all this without any trade offs, right?"
1619233602.0,2021-04-23 23:06:42,3,3,I don't think it is supposed to be used for daily transactions.   It's treated as a store of value.   When you sell property there are often huge fees involved. That doesn't make property worthless art all though.  It's not only one cryptocurrency that can have value. Bitcoin can have it's place as can other cryptos with different properties.
1619236233.0,2021-04-23 23:50:33,1,2,"Bitcoin can do anything  the altcoins can do, but the development  is slower because security  is #1 and fancy things are #2. I don't  see Billionaires FOMOing into Poopcoin anytime soon."
1619241312.0,2021-04-24 01:15:12,0,2,"I would love to see litecoin be a true second layer for bitcoin but it doesn’t seem like that’s ever gonna happen.

1619233617.0,2021-04-23 23:06:57,0,3,"The business model of the company that controls BTC development relies on the network having high fees.  So they attack any actual attempt to scale and use r/Bitcoin and other platforms to censor anyone who disagrees with them, and they’ve been doing it for years.  It’s even the reason Bitcoin Cash was created since some Bitcoin people wanted to get away from those devs’ control over the network and make it more useful as money (so of course they attacked and censored that too).  And still they don’t seem to actually be making any money somehow but they’re still dedicated to the cause of making sure BTC isn’t usable."

Lightning is not a good solution, I would be very surprised to see it ever reach critical mass.  I disagree on alts.  I personally think we will eventually have BTC for savings, ETH 2.0 for DeFi, and fiat stable coins (digital government backed currencies) as well as internalized BTC trading from payment providers like PayPal and Venmo.  As much as I enjoy the tech and degenerate gambling I mean trading, I personally do not see a likely scenario where altcoins will have a big role."

1619202743.0,2021-04-23 14:32:23,2,2,"If you dont mind me asking, you never pulled out of precious metals and got back into crypto as prices started to rise again?"

1619213794.0,2021-04-23 17:36:34,0,1,I’m kinda surprised just how badly gold and silver perform

1619203061.0,2021-04-23 14:37:41,4,0,If Bitcoin went down 20% and if I had 1 btc does that mean I have 0.8 btc now
1619224126.0,2021-04-23 20:28:46,0,8,I did the same... but with cocaine...  5 to 10 bitcoin every couple of weeks....  for about 3 years...   oh my the things I could buy today.....
1619205699.0,2021-04-23 15:21:39,1,5,Those are some expensive bowls
1619208797.0,2021-04-23 16:13:17,0,2,I look at the gold and I’m like “Schiff would like these $150k gold coins”.  Oof. Did I really spend 3 btc per gold coin?
1619203932.0,2021-04-23 14:52:12,0,4,"I had VeChain, BNB, IOTA, NEO, and a few others on Binance back in 2018. All bought for practically nothing (except IOTA, maybe). Had planned to hold them for years. But then Binance kicked off all the US customers and there wasn't a good way to move the coins off the exchange so I sold them all, thinking I'd just buy them back. But I got annoyed with it all and didn't. Now VET and BNB are both at least 100x what I paid for them back then. I think the others are up significantly too, but not that much.   I guess the lesson is to buy early and just hold for years. Forget you own them. But try to buy during the bear markets mainly, too. I guess DCA'ing is actually the best way since it's impossible to really know whether a bear market is coming and what prices that actually will mean."
1619203565.0,2021-04-23 14:46:05,1,2,I would be overjoyed it VET went parabolic. I think it might be my largest holding right now from buying over time since i got started a couple months ago.

1619208559.0,2021-04-23 16:09:19,0,1,"Just buying crypto when I can I suppose. Can’t change what happened, but I definitely won’t panic sell anymore. Not going to hodl everything forever...but will be more calculated on taking profits and whatnot."
1619208280.0,2021-04-23 16:04:40,0,2,"Sold for the precious metal and then once they came in the mail (if I remember correctly) Bitcoin hopped up a little bit, but gold had a slightly stronger uptick. So I was like “in the smartest man alive!” Then when the value “flipped” back to btc being dominant, I was just stubborn. Then life got busy and I didn’t pay daily attention to the charts. Then things went crazy on btc and I couldn’t take my eyes off it, but just kept the precious metal because at that point I didn’t want to take a loss on the gold and go back to btc.  Had no idea December 2017 or this latest bullrun was going to happen, sooo yea.  Hindsight and all.  Would have done things differently"
1619203597.0,2021-04-23 14:46:37,0,1,Interesting point.
1619208335.0,2021-04-23 16:05:35,0,2,I still made profit...so I guess that’s a good thing? I mean profit is profit.  But man oh man lol
1619203776.0,2021-04-23 14:49:36,0,2,Ofc not. 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC. Don't forget this.
1619208715.0,2021-04-23 16:11:55,0,1,1 btc will always be 1 btc. But in your example the 1 btc is worth 20% less fiat than it was before it went down. Most people around here would say you should buy more at a discount.  If you believe in the project (in this case btc) just don’t panic sell. Patience is key
1619213345.0,2021-04-23 17:29:05,0,1,No you still have 1btc  But the value of btc is what changes  You still have the same thing and amount but the value of it changes overtime.  Up or down.
1619262094.0,2021-04-24 07:01:34,0,1,"No, you will still have 1 BTC, but if we pretend BTC was worth 1000€ before it went down, you still have 1 BTC but it's now worth only 800€."

1619146289.0,2021-04-22 22:51:29,2,42,This seems like a clear sign that people either have too much financially or emotionally invested and should take a step back. No amount of profit is worth your sanity.

1619157215.0,2021-04-23 01:53:35,0,6,I was feeling down today when I saw my portfolio balance and then I zoomed out and saw that this was my exact balance 2 weeks ago when I felt great about it.
1619158953.0,2021-04-23 02:22:33,0,6,The bull run had been going so long right now... Remember back then when 30K on BTC meant you are going to get a lot of money or when it goes through 50K it means insane returns?  Correction can feel a lot like a crash though. I would only define this as a real crash if it dips below the 20K.
1619146556.0,2021-04-22 22:55:56,3,15,"This is the first semi-proper dip that we've had. Everything before this was a nothing burger.  If you ever wanted to buy something at a lower price point, now is your time. Alternatively, you can wait and see if it goes lower.  Or don't.  Do whatever you want, this ain't no GD financial advice."
1619148384.0,2021-04-22 23:26:24,1,15,Hitting 50k ATH for the first time and a +20% correction are two very different things
1619147104.0,2021-04-22 23:05:04,0,5,people's attention spans are short.   they pay attention when shit makes news.  get mad at it and then leave.  it's nature leave it be. 🤣
1619158563.0,2021-04-23 02:16:03,1,5,CMV: 90% are only in crypto to get rich fast and only give a shit about „huge adoptions“ because it drives the price up. We still have almost zero adoption of the crypto space considering there are so many coins.

1619157543.0,2021-04-23 01:59:03,0,3,"Now each of us knows that the bull run will also have an end sometime.  I am not one of the users who is new to it. I bought my first coins in 2016.   And in 2011 as a dumb script kiddy I had my first touch points with bitcoin. But at that time I didn't want Bitcoins for the sale of Steam accounts but real money. What an idiot I was back then haha  &#x200B;  Anyway, I pulled out most of my coins this week. On one hand my gut tells me that this dip is different and on the other hand I read a lot of analysis that said the fina run is here. Of course you can very well be wrong and it is just a correction. What I also really hope for all who are still in it. But in my opinion it is not wrong to get his sheep in the dry."
1619158365.0,2021-04-23 02:12:45,0,3,I remember seeing the hype of 2017 where Bitcoin rose to great heights and crashed again. But a lot of people who held are thankful to have done that now. Crypto is volatile. Hold and try not to worry about these dips too much
1619161827.0,2021-04-23 03:10:27,0,3,"It is one thing hitting 50k going up and another entirely coming down, especially after 60+k.  It could be a dip and if so, noting to freak out about. But no one here is a fortune teller, so it could also mean a decisive change in momentum in the market.  So yeah, even if you are experienced in dips (2017 rekt gang here), there is no guarantee this is either a dip or the beginning of a bear market. We are all betting and god knows who'll win that wager right now."

It was summer 2019, so eth was around $300, and BTC was around $9K. Accepted the initial investment as a loss and just forgot about it until the current run-up.

Like your example when it was at 50k it was monumental, then it keeps creeping up and we realise it's going to keep going. Inside we're all thinking ""MORE, MORE"" and when it trails back down a bit we have less profit and become annoyed it's falling back to what literally was monumental, which the majority wouldn't care about after the milestone been passed"

Starting to get excited and my holdings weren’t very large..  Pretty new here don’t get me wrong and this is my first dip, but it just makes sense.  When it goes up it’s a load of fun being part of it, talking on reddit, twitter etc.... But tbh I’ve been finding it a lot more fun when it dips!  When it’s up I’m constantly thinking about if I should sell or make a move or what not, when it dips I know I’m fucked and just waiting for my paycheck so we all just group up and watch it burn.  Feels like being on a boat riding the waves with a crew while holding on cheering for one another and the sentiment is a lot more teamlike during the dips!"

Also we have all seen large dips, but this one is the largest since the start of the current bull market, so obviously people are panicking.  What did most of you expect ?  This ""dip"" is a reminder that bitcoin is volatile, and that the reality is we know nothing about it's future because it depends on so many factors there is no human being who can predict anything regarding bitcoin with a 100% reliability.  The only thing we know for sure is that some people or entities are big enough to have a noticeable impact on the trends. If anyone can predict anything, they are the ones."

Back in 2017 it kept going up after I sold, then it tanked and we had ""crypto winter"" for a bit more than two years, but in the end it sill went above my sell price.  It just took longer.  This year it blew past $40,000 in short order.  Every time I sold BTC was at a local high or at a ATH.  It will absolutely get better, but it might take a while. Hopefully not two years again though.  Some BTC prices I have sold at:  2013:  $410 - Just before the \~$1K ATH  2017:  $8,000  $10,000  $15,000  2019:  $10,000  2021:  $40,700"
1619187500.0,2021-04-23 10:18:20,0,1,That's because they look at the chart and notice bearish patterns forming.  This is likely the end of the bull run for now.  Crypto doesn't go straight up forever. If your not ok giving back 80 percent of what you have made it's time to get out and wait a year for the bottom consolidation.  If your cool riding the ship down then back up that's awesome.  But the chart says the bull is done for a while.  Now it's time for pain.  I'm taking 15k btc btw.  In 2017 this sub looked just like it does now. Believe me most of you will not hold through the pain. You will sell the bottom.    Don't be greedy or make a deal with yourself now that your not going to sell even when you think crypto is dead.  Believe me that's what it will feel like at the actual bottom. You will think maybe they were right.. Market maybe crypto is useless.  I know you don't think that now and you're all devout worshippers because you made money. Believe me that feeling well change unless you're ready for it.  Where is the deepest pain for your?  10k.. 15k.. 6k???   Ask yourself if your ready for that.  Crypto is the future of finance but you can bet your ass it will be a bumpy uncomfortable ride.

Before everyone dumps and let’s the bigger whales and institutions grab all this for a fraction of the cost, take a step back and look at the longer term charts. Even the daily chart can fill you in with the trend. It’s normal ☺️. Quit putting the funds you can’t afford! That’s the only thing that makes it scary to hodl. If it’s left over funds that would have went to pizza, beer, weed, chegg study pack, etc, it’s already doing better than all those investments hahah  Also, find one project that’s your main. Do the research, and make sure the project provides utility! A must! Mine turned into cosmos after deep diving into all projects that offer interoperability and scaling. One of a kind. Cosmos is going to strengthen all projects haha hopefully including ADA if it decides to hop on the IBC “fingers crossed”.

Any time S2F is wrong people just ""correct it"" or say the model wasn't calibrated properly, use this one instead, which is picking the winners after the horses have ran. You don't get points for ""predicting"" the future after its already happened by retroactively picking the prediction that turned out to be right and ignoring the thousands that turned out to be wrong.   It's pseudoscientific nonsense barely above TA. You can't calculate a complex multivariable like price from 2 factors."

The absence of sports events during covid has pushed a lot of people to the stock market and they invest like they were betting on teams. This has brought wild behavior to the market that seems to be influencing price action.  Who knows how much of that is happening to crypto right now.

I wasn't implying that they currently use it.  Sorry, I thought we were talking about how its actually being used now.  >That being said, Crypto.com is now able to settle their payments with VISA on the Ethereum blockchain  Settlement is what banks (or payment processors) do when they've moved dollars on paper and need to actually consolidate the transfer, since if bank A moves $500,000 to Bank B, and Bank B moves $600,000 to Bank A, its cheaper and easier to just to move the difference rather than to move $600,000 one way and then move $500,000 of that $600,000 straight back.  Banks aren't settling millions of individual transactions separately, they're bundling them and only moving the difference.  It doesn't make any sense to say that you can use bitcoin to settle fiat transactions, since a fiat transaction needs to be settled in fiat.  The only way you could do that is for Bank A to move X amount of bitcoin to Bank B, and then for Bank B to sell it on an exchange for fiat. At which point the combined exchange fee and price instability would more than cancel out any benefit on fees.  Also central banks are developing digital currencies that will allow for effectively free and instant settlement between users, removing the need for clearing houses, and do not require any of the inefficiency or latency of a blockchain. So even if this use case got up and running immediately, it would be very rapidly made obsolete."

If you buy bitcoin on Crypto.com from your Visa card, or sell Bitcoin for USD, the transaction can't be settled in anything but fiat because your bank account doesn't accept USDC.  What's actually happening is Visa will now accept payment from Crypto.com in USDC instead of USD, but Visa still need to sell USDC for USD (or other fiat) to settle payments because Visa cards connect to banks, and banks require settlement in fiat. You can't withdraw USDC from an ATM.  People are saying ""settlement"" because it sounds a lot more hype in fintech to say you're creating a new settlement layer than it does to say you're accepting a stablecoin that you're immediately selling for fiat.  It hasn't improved the settlement layer because you still have to settle with banks, its just added another layer of bureaucracy (their digitial bank partner Anchorage who converts USDC to USD for Visa), whose only true utility is to cream middleman fees off speculators, but it sounds a lot better when you talk as if its revolutionizing finance.  For this to be replacing bank settlement banks would have to start opening USDC accounts and then it would still only work with people with a USDC account, not a USD bank account."

Based on the recent BTC dip and the mass’s reactions, he thinks the next crypto winter will be an absolute bloodbath.  I find it both exciting and concerning bc I, too, now have skin in the game.

However it is still good to invest on altcoins like COTI and UTK as these tokens are payment gateways for crypto currency. Looks like crypto payment is going mainstream and we dont want to miss the possible gains!!!
1619247741.0,2021-04-24 03:02:21,0,0,You can buy the coins which are lower in price. Buying $1k of BTC will not give you good returns unless it crosses $100k

1619260344.0,2021-04-24 06:32:24,1,6,USDT sadly.
1619261208.0,2021-04-24 06:46:48,1,4,no one knows but VET still has great gains comparing to ten days ago
1619260783.0,2021-04-24 06:39:43,1,2,ADA/COTI/HOT     Reasons? because I have them. Same reason why anyone here believes something will pump.
1619262331.0,2021-04-24 07:05:31,0,2,I’m hoping Cardano tbh.
1619261259.0,2021-04-24 06:47:39,0,1,"I'm betting on trustswap, launchpool and layer as long term growth opportunities."
1619261283.0,2021-04-24 06:48:03,1,1,ETH and BNB
1619262088.0,2021-04-24 07:01:28,0,1,"DGB and SC, for utility I love Siacoin’s tech and skynet’s possibilities for the future of the internet. With DGB it’s just a much better UTXO then Bitcoin and LTC, once people find that out and money is flowing to alts DGB will pick up a lot of steam."
1619262437.0,2021-04-24 07:07:17,0,1,KCS
1619263448.0,2021-04-24 07:24:08,0,1,"ETH, BNB, VET and many more. They all still correlate with BTC, so we need BTC to rise up too and not fall down."
1619265414.0,2021-04-24 07:56:54,0,1,"I drank the kool-aid on HBAR’s utility and staying power. The brands that have joined their governing council are really impressive and I’m looking at hbar as my long term lotto ticket.

1619265489.0,2021-04-24 07:58:09,1,1,What do you mean Doge being worth more than the US dollar? Are you referring to if Doge hits 1+ dollar?
1619260265.0,2021-04-24 06:31:05,2,-1,Nano and Monero. Those are superior SoV + MoE that will fill the gap that BTC lost.
1619260390.0,2021-04-24 06:33:10,1,1,Isn't the whole point of USDT is that is will always be approximately equal to $1...?
1619261240.0,2021-04-24 06:47:20,1,1,So does doge 👀
1619260843.0,2021-04-24 06:40:43,0,1,I like ADA as well.
1619261354.0,2021-04-24 06:49:14,0,1,I agree with this
1619265558.0,2021-04-24 07:59:18,1,1,It's not an if. It's inevitable.
1619260663.0,2021-04-24 06:37:43,0,1,"I could definitely see XMR going up. What about BNB though, because alt coins will be on the rise, most people will be utilizing bnb to swap out for alt coins?"
1619260907.0,2021-04-24 06:41:47,1,0,With all the the growing cries for regulstion for bitcoin this could accelerate the growth of these two as well. In my easy mind though
1619260460.0,2021-04-24 06:34:20,1,2,"Lol USDT hit $1.01 a few days ago when crypto was crashing as demand was more than supply.  In a perfect world, yes stablecoin is stable but it can fluctuate during flash crashes."

1619265708.0,2021-04-24 08:01:48,1,1,So the moment something costs more than 1 dollar it's worth more than the US economy or what is your implication here?
1619262202.0,2021-04-24 07:03:22,1,1,Are you suggesting Bitcoin would be regulated but altcoins would not?
1619260723.0,2021-04-24 06:38:43,0,1,Not really an investment play for me to try to catch a falling knife unfortunately lol.
1619262321.0,2021-04-24 07:05:21,0,2,Y'all really don't understand the importance of doge and what it's doing huh... Smh too proud to even see it
1619265892.0,2021-04-24 08:04:52,1,1,I'm saying people will start to understand the issues with centralized finance and the banking system. They'll start to question WHY a meme can be valued more and start to understand the importance of decentralized currencies!
1619266736.0,2021-04-24 08:18:56,0,1,"Not at all, short term people might think, hop to monero and boost the price.  Should have stated that. Thx for showing"
1619266296.0,2021-04-24 08:11:36,1,1,"Can you tell me why the value of nothing lends credibility to crypto currency? Why is it that the value of a meme, as you can it, is somehow a wakeup call?  The world is full of shit that's irrationally priced. 600 dollar HDMI cables, the price of GME, gucci bags and the wheel on the Mac Pro.  I'm trying to understand the argument that people will see the value of doge, and then realize ""holy shit the banks are fucking me""  What is the intermediate steps between the two?"
1619266546.0,2021-04-24 08:15:46,1,0,"I think more people will start to research crypto based off of the assumption doge hits $1. That will lead to them researching why crypto exists, why it's important, and why they should be invested in it."

How many millionaires are there in the US that it could have such an impact on crypto. I don't think that's what causing this dip at all.

1619189789.0,2021-04-23 10:56:29,0,6,"Exactly. If it wasn't the tax proposal, there was also the [Turkish exchange that went under and stole $2 Billion of customers' funds](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/bitcoin-btc-ceo-of-turkish-cryptocurrency-exchange-thodex-missing.html) and the [power cut in China](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/bitcoin-price-china-power-cut-b1834446.html) which caused hash rates to plummet.

Also part of the fear is the purposed taxing of unrealized gains (taxed without selling anything).

1619190328.0,2021-04-23 11:05:28,1,4,I think BTC will hit $100k end of year and then crash HARD. Like $20-30k in Jan-Feb 2022.
1619193481.0,2021-04-23 11:58:01,0,8,It's not just the tax proposal.  End of month options are expiring.  Turkey just had some crypto exchange pull a Bitconnect with billions of people's money.  Some other way over leveraged whales got margin called a few days ago.  Real answer imo is just that it's normal for things to go down a little bit after being up. If growth is a straight vertical shot then that's an artificial pump.

For example Tezos is heavily invested in creating the digital euro and they are progressing in France right now. Then look at china they are already trying to implement  a digital Yuan.
