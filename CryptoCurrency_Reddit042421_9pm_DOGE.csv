1619216611.0,2021-04-23 18:23:31,2,34,Posts like these convinced me not to invest when doge was less than a cent. They convinced me it wasn’t possible to rise. Then it was .05 and more posts just like this convinced me it was a fluke and would dive back down. Then 0.10. Now I’m kicking myself for listening to these posts and believing it was not possible. I’m not making that mistake again. Even if it takes years and I’m all aboard the doge train now.

1619200137.0,2021-04-23 13:48:57,3,155,"Those people saying Doge to $100 are ridiculous. Also ridiculous is to talk about crytpo market cap as a static thing that can never go up like bitcoin didn't increase by a factor of 8 in a year.    Doge to $1-2 is very reasonable in the short term. Long term who knows, but probably not going to crazy beyond that. Doge at sub $1 has a potential value in a way that others don't given it's appeal, spread, and accessibility. Trashing a coin that has a real case to increase by a factor of four in the near term future because you don't think it will increase by a factor of 400 is stupid."

1619200537.0,2021-04-23 13:55:37,7,73,"YOU ARE USING MARKET CAP INCORRECTLY.  Changing the market DOES NOT change the price.  YOU CANNOT USE MARKET CAP AS A WAY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PRICE WILL BE - You can’t do that because the market cap IS what the value of the total supply is at the current cost.   YOU CANT CHANGE ADD OR DECREASE MARKET CAP TO GET A DIFFERENT VALUE - you can only change the price and supply.   ALSO MARKET CAP DOES NOT = DOLLARS IN THE SYSTEM  You’re also not understanding how little supply increase actually affects things. The supply of Dogecoin is NOT infinite. to have an infinite supply you need infinite time. It take 24 YEARS for the supply of Dogecoin to double.  The price and supply change the market cap - completely different.     Economically speaking Dogecoin can rise to whatever value the market dictates based off of supply and demand. As long as demand out paces the supply then the value will rise.   I will take your point and explain it correctly.   I also see people asking what’s stopping Dogecoin from going to bitcoin levels? Well, The short answer is the supply of Dogecoin is high relative to the supply of bitcoin. Dogecoin has a current supply of 128 billion, which is why the price is lower and harder to change in value. It is easier for bitcoin to rise $1 in price because the supply of bitcoin is so low and the supply of Dogecoin is so high.  It doesn’t mean that Dogecoin can’t rise in price - just that it’s harder.   This is the long answer. First, It is important to note that demand does not necessarily equate to adding dollars to the system in 1 to 1 ratio. Demand can increase without ever having to add money into the system, however, adding new money into the system does help. I see people saying Dogecoin requires X million dollars per minute to account for the increase in supply. That is just completely wrong, and not how demand works. Increased Demand just means more people willing to trade Dogecoin at a higher price than people willing to trade at the current price. No net increase in fiat currency needs to be added in order for demand to increase.   Despite not having a capped supply, using the current supply known, as well as the mining rate to account for new coins entering - you can make comparisons to other cryptocurrency to get an idea of the demand required in order for Dogecoin to reach a certain price.  The way to do this is through market cap comparisons   Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply)  Before moving forward, I want to explain market cap and the misconceptions behind its as well as how to correctly use it.   Market cap just means how much the total supply is “valued/worth” at a certain price. The exact definition applies to stocks; not cryptocurrency how ever for our purposes the mathematics still apply. I see people saying how Dogecoin has a current market cap of $X billion market cap and what the market cap needs to be for Dogecoin to be $1 is $128 billion. Then they say if 100 million people put $1000 in doge then doge will = $1.  THAT’S NOT HOW MARKET CAP WORKS.  *MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. When I originally wrote this people got confused so I wanted to clarify that. Market cap is a comparison tool that I use in this example to show how Dogecoin would look at each price point*  Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap in the same way it does not necessarily change the price/demand. The only two variables that change the market cap are price and supply nothing else can change the market cap.   Market caps REAL use is a comparison tool. It’s used to compare how successful a market is compared to other markets.   If Dogecoin were to reach $1 today it would have a market cap of about 128 billion dollars ($1 x 128,495,957,919 circulating supply). Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency) currently has a market cap of approximately $898,761,019,333 (~ $900 billion). This means that at $1, the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply.   The take away from this comparison is that in order to reach $1 Dogecoin would require approximately 1/7th the current demand of bitcoin due to the differences in supply between Dogecoin and bitcoin. This is definitely not impossible, and an achievable goal. If Dogecoin were to reach the demand bitcoin has currently - its price would $7. Since bitcoin is the highest performing cryptocurrency, $7 dollars is the most realistic possible goal at current market conditions. Anything past $7 dollars per coin means that Dogecoin is reaching uncharted territory for cryptocurrency as it will have surpassed bitcoin.  Now for the hypothetical extension of this comparison. Everything after this point is hypothetical since we don’t have a true comparison available in the market  The estimated supply of the US dollar is about $2,000,000,000 (2 trillion), thus the market cap of the US currency is $2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach the equivalent market cap ($2tn / $128bn), the price per Dogecoin would have to be $15.60, thus matching the entire short-term US currency (M0 money supply in economics).  This is definitely not impossible, but it is highly highly improbable to reach such value any time soon. If that were to ever happen, it would take years. Now, the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat (short-term liquidity / paper) currency is $37 trillion. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value of Dogecoin would have to be $288.60. If it was valued any higher than that amount, Dogecoin would be ""worth"" more than the entire world’s short-term liquidity currencies combined. It could technically go past this point, but what that would mean is that the economy behind Dogecoin would be stronger than the entire global economy of today. At that value you wouldn’t even compare it to the dollar anymore because it already surpassed all fiat currency. It’s not impossible- but is is highly unrealistic to pass that point. It is important to note that this number is not static. Which means if the market conditions change such as an increase in supply or change in price the numbers will change."

1619190108.0,2021-04-23 11:01:48,8,168,"Market Cap is a construct. Suppose everyone HODLs and the supply on exchange goes to near zero. A single buyer could pay a few bucks to send the ""price"" super high. Does that person's couple of bucks make DOGE worth billions more? No. Market cap assumes every holder can sell at the current price without affecting the price, which is preposterous; it doesn't really tell you much in the end."
1619197738.0,2021-04-23 13:08:58,3,31,"You are making a little too much of a fuss over the supply not being capped. It is adding less than 5% of coins a year and this percentage will only go down. It is not different than inflation and it can be healthy. Also, it is hardly the only coin that has this property but only doge gets bashed about it here. I don’t have a position in doge and I don’t believe it will ever reach $100 but it could well get close to $10 at least temporarily imo"
1619198399.0,2021-04-23 13:19:59,1,34,"I mean you're also assuming the market cap for these other companies stays constant. They're likely going to continue to rise throughout the years.   Take bitcoin for example, currently has a $1.1 trillion market cap, but took 12 years to get there. Apple's market cap is currently $2.2 trillion, but 12 years ago it was $114 billion, so it grew almost 20x in 12 years.   Because of supply, it's impossible for Doge to outpace Bitcoin, but who knows where it's going to be say 10 years from now. But comparing a possible $10/coin valuation to current company market caps is an unfair comparison because for one crypto markets are relatively new and unpredictable, and second those companies are going to continue to grow also.   I'm not advocating Doge, I'm just saying comparing future projected values of crypto to current tangible companies is arbitrary. People would have said the same about bitcoin 12 years ago."

I am holding Doge because I believe one day it will be more widely accepted and to me that possibility makes doge worth far more that 1 USD TO ME.     You compare Doge’s market cap to Facebook and Tesla but this is a CURRENCY we are talking about here.  Do you have any idea the market cap of the US dollar itself?  I’ll give you a hint, 6 trillion more USD were added to the supply last year and it hardly moved the needle in terms of its value relative to the rest of the world.  You say Doge’s limitless supply is a problem but any government currency supply is also essentially limitless as well.  Now maybe the Doge fizzles into irrelevance after people turn their attention elsewhere but I love what the doge community does and stands for and so I will HODL a fair bit of doge for the foreseeable future.

1619229447.0,2021-04-23 21:57:27,0,5,"Honestly the inflation part of Dogecoin isn't so bad in reality.   Year over year the inflation will be less. It won't stop like bitcoins, but BTC is also currently inflationary.  Dogecoin is sort of a pipe dream but I wouldn't sleep on it as much as old Crypto holders are.   Most people understand that a $10 doge coin is unrealistic, but so is that $500k Bitcoin I saw people  talking about.  Know one knows where crypto is going, but all I can say is that regardless of what you know, crypto isn't predictable.  Doge could hit $1 it could hit $10 we don't know.at what time scale, but I wouldnt write it out yet. It's incredibly popular currently, lots of people own it, many people are buying it. Because of its spike dev interest has picked up on it. I would say it is just starting its life cycle, amd while it is definitely not the best coin, adoption is what matters and currently doge coin adoption is growing faster than any other coin.  I think it's a bit too dismive of this subreddit to keep putting it down. There is a small chance that it actually becomes the most usable crypto  currency by the gen-z because they can buy whole coins and its incredibly popular on social media, and they see what Bitcoin did so they don't want to miss out on its growth.   People here act like doge investors don't understand tokenomics, they do. Let them dream just like people dream on Bitcoin and ethereum.   We are at the beginning of crypto, often times it isnt the best tech that wins, it's what people use and remember. Tech can be improved, adoption is honestly what matters right now. Bitcoin has just started corporate adoption and it's limited supply is actually likely holding it back. Markets need liquidity to operate well. Doge will always have a fixed amount of liquidity woth billions printed a year.  Who knows what it's market cap will end up at but sleeping on Doge coin may one day be like missing out on bitcoin. or at least missing out on some ridiculous gains."

Even with 14.4 million doge mined a day, we have until May 2022 to hit the all time market cap again and still get it back to 40 cents.  For reference if it gets back to the all time market cap By March 1st 2023, it will be worth 39 cents. The key is to not panic sell, and hodl for some confluence of idiots pushing the coin (which is not a valuable coin with no cap, with top 10 wallets owning 45% of entire cap, THIS IS A GAMBLE, so be honest about it).  Given those risks I'm betting the hype hits that all time cap in the next few months again, and I'll dip out at 39 cents about.

1619217663.0,2021-04-23 18:41:03,0,5,"In the end, Doge will likely be around forever. It was a gateway crypto for a lot of people (myself included). I put in $200 when it was at $0.05 because I missed the GME hype and wanted to get in on something. There was so much talk about how “this is the next GME” and “sticking it to the man” on the r/dogecoin and talking about buying shares instead of coins. I didn’t know much about crypto, but I knew that they weren’t called “shares”. That’s when I started looking into real projects, wanting to learn what would be a good investment, making my own informed decisions. Doge went sideways for a while so I totally forgot about it until there was news it was mooning. Cashed out a majority as it was crashing from $0.40 then put it into “real” projects I think will do well in the long term. I was one of those people that thought it would get to $1, $10, maybe even $100...but that was before I understood anything about crypto. So I will always be thankful for that stupid dog meme for helping me learn how to be a bit more financially literate and I think others feel the same way."
1619218944.0,2021-04-23 19:02:24,0,5,No one knows what Doge coin may end up doing. If the popularity goes viral and every business on the planet starts accepting it and people pay using it there is no reason it could not shoot past an Apple valuation. If it becomes a dominant global currency it could go much higher than any stock. Is any of this likely to happen? No but stranger things have happened in the world.
1619202357.0,2021-04-23 14:25:57,3,9,"It’s funny that you had to raise this to $10 and $100 when you must know full well the main price target thrown around was $1. I guess you didn’t want to do those estimates because it wouldn’t fit your narrative.   It’s funny too that you won’t do similar calculations for the price targets that are confidently predicted and praised in here for Bitcoin. If you did that for $500k or $1 million dollar BTC you would arrive at similar ridiculously unsustainable figures. But again, that wouldn’t fit your constructed narrative."
1619193003.0,2021-04-23 11:50:03,1,6,"One thing to think about is a currency isn't a company. Another to think about is to say ask what the total number of dollars in circulation, and whether cryptocurrency will be used on a similar scale in the future. You might ask: how much currency is there of all kinds in the world? Will crypto reach that kind of scale or no? You should compare currency to currency. A third is to realise that inflation can be a good thing for currency, like inflation in USD is good for the US in terms of growth.  Is it unreasonable to think that Doge reaches $10? It depends on what you think the total market for cryptocurrency will be in the future, and who the winners will be (but yeah maybe it is crazy). $100 is obviously insane, but even with inflation you could image it is possible for Doge to have a steady conversion rate of $2-3, if people actually use it. It seems likely that within 10 years the total value of all crypto will be far higher than it is today, so it seems like to really get under the problem you need to think about how often and common use of crypto will be in the future, and what crypto might be the most widely used. If people really like Doge they might overlook a lot of things, because they just happen to use it and like it.   The meme aspect is completely irrelevant. What matters is if it used long term, not whether it was created as a meme or people like it for that reason. This is the genetic fallacy."
1619191960.0,2021-04-23 11:32:40,3,10,"If Doge maintains its price at whatever level and doesn't really go up or go down, because of the circulating supply it's market cap is increasing. If it does maintain its price it will eventually overtake Bitcoin by market cap even when it's only worth 20 or 30 cents. At that point I hope finally people will stop talking about market cap like it's some meaningful metric for currency."

That's 14.4 million per day.  1 billion every seventy days.  So, if Doge were to reach $1, just to HOLD it's value, it would need $1 billion in new investment every 70 days. That's insane.   A lot of doge holders think it can be priced as high as bitcoin."
1619207124.0,2021-04-23 15:45:24,0,4,"The US prints ~$38,051 every second, while doge mints 167 tokens. In reality doge could easily be more stable than USD, and the fact that people treat crypto as a security rather than a currency is the only reason doge “can’t reach $1”.  Crypto was never supposed to be like that, it’s original intention was to replace country gdp backed currency, with a standard, worldwide token. I’m not saying it will reach $10, but it easily can.  I purchased Bitcoin in 2012 and not a single person thought that was a good idea and were saying the exact same thing. I cashed out at a great time and had the last laugh, but I only sold for the price I did because I literally waited 4 years holding it to get the bag I did, and doge could easily be the same (not sure about 50k valuation but $10 in the next 3-5 years is by no means impossible).    Also saying 100 accounts have 90 whatever % of doge is an issue is completely false. Elon musk owns 21% of Tesla, which if he left and sold would cripple the company (which is already valued at the price it should be 20 years from now, before they accomplish any of the tech that would get them there). Same goes with every other company with a founder CEO/board director, so I don’t think it matters.  The US has a combined total wealth of ~$71.864 trillion (with debt taken out), while the top 1% owns over $34 trillion. Meaning rich people own ~47% of all US assets (personal, corporate, and government assets combined). So the wealth distribution really doesn’t matter because it’s broken literally everywhere."

We expect crypto to be worth more than these stocks because we would use them to buy goods, services, and even these stocks themselves (one can dream)  Comparing the two doesn't make sense  It is in all of our best interests that DOGE reach a market cap above Bitcoin and large companies. Arguably, it is inevitable once crypto becomes more widely accepted as a currency and if DOGE evolves as a coin  Personally, DOGE should not become widely adopted in its current state due to its low TPS and lack of usefulness right now. I don't hold any and don't intend to. But it's power to make people realize that crypto is the the future of currency is above all else"

The entire crypto space is built on the notion of fiat currency having no intrinsic value, yet fiat currency can buy you anything you want if you have enough of it. In fact, in most cases, if you want your crypto to have real purchasing power, you have to first sell it for fiat. And even in the days when fiat was backed up with precious metals, those metals have no intrinsic value either. So, value imparted onto an object is value attained by that object.  With Doge, people decided it had a certain value. The question really seems to be what kind of value people have given it. If most people think of it as a pump and dump, that will be reflected in the price as it goes way up and crashes, possibly in a cycle. If more people decide it’s a good long term investment and buy and hold, doesn’t it become useful in that way, simply by virtue of people treating it that way?  I’m a total dumbass novice."

It is meant to expand according to demand. So it will suffer inflation. However Ethereum's value comes not from its supply or its scarcity but it's ability to run smart contracts.  Smart Contracts fuel DeFi; which is honestly where the real money is in Crypto, not just buying and holding.  As long as Ethereum is underwriting most DeFi contracts, it can withstand inflation and an uncapped supply.  So the problem with betting on Dogecoin to moon, isn't its marketcap nor its supply. The problem with Dogecoin is it's use case.  Unlike ADA and Ethereum, it is not going to lay the foundation for a decentralized financial system, holding billions and possibly trillions of dollars of digital assets. Cardano plans to introduce DeFi to their blockchain, this summer; or whenever their smart contracts go live.  Dogecoin's best use case is similar to Reddit Coins. Something to be brought only to be given away freely, either for laughs or good vibes. It's also interesting that a lot of people buy Dogecoin on places where they can't transfer it out to be given away.  So they can't even use it the way it was meant to use.  However Dogecoin's recent success only signals we are in a boom market. In boom markets fundamentals don't matter. Memes and Hype does.

1619275197.0,2021-04-24 10:39:57,0,2,"I think that you dont understand what the market cap is and how it changes. Market cap is a theoretical number that is determined by the price. For instance, if someone wanted to buy every dogecoin there is he would need the current market cap amount of money which is  €28,995,678,302 . But if this someone really started buying doge then he would make a great demand for dogecoin and the price would actually increase and he would eventually need FAR more than €28,995,678,302 to buy every single dogecoin. So what you re saying is that in order to have a price of 1 or 10 dollars you ll need a bigger market cap, but what is actually needed is a bigger demand/offer ratio for the coin than it currently is. If more poeple want to buy and less people want to sell you could see a great increase in the price whatsoever"

The Dogecoin core wallet still has known bugs from LTC days and getting a copy of the entire blockchain to participate in mining/seeding the chain is an effort of at least a week's time.  And in practice, most people will have no idea how to get it working.  I've been participating in Cryptocurrencies since 2010 and it took me a week of solid work to recover a wallet with a few tens of thousands of coins and then move it.  The problem being the Dogecoin ecosystem is shit, the software support is shit, and the network is not healthy enough to support native block sync between nodes.  The only way to use dogecoin is to use a broker, or use bittorrent to get a pre-seeded copy of the chain.  Doge has lots of wallets that are abandoned due to various multi-wallets no longer supporting them, (dead wallets now)  miners who didn't know what they were doing etc.  A change in the paper wallet format also caused a bunch of abandoned wallets.   Now there's a large number of coins that just \*can't\* move so that gives you what appears to be a reserve, but is really not that."

1619251615.0,2021-04-24 04:06:55,0,2,"Disagree. One reason Long term holders of doge Are doing so is because they believe the coin may become a general method of payment for day to day transactions. This might not happen. It also might happen.  So there are several reasons why doge is a good prospect and the supply cap is actually one of them: it doesn’t have unlimited supply, that is a misinterpretation. It’s true that the supply increases each year for endless number of years, but it’s with a fixed number each year. Here is were it gets interesting. The CAP is MISUNDERSTOOD! Dogecoin is DEFLATIONARY!  For people who say Dogecoin is ""unlimited"" or ""permanently inflationary""  1.	⁠As of today there are a 129 BN coins in circulation with 5.3 BN added each year. This translates to a supply inflation of currently 3.9% per year, and it falls every year (as 5.3 bn out of for example 200 BN coins in ca 15 years is a smaller fraction right) 2.	⁠Over time new supply eventually would fall to an arbitrarily low value (0.0000000000001% per year, etc) but can never reach exactly 0%. 3.	⁠There are always coins lost due to abandoned dust and lost keys. At some point (and maybe already) these lost coins will outweigh the new supply. Therefore Dogecoin is a deflationary coin.  In other terms.  4. It. Takes. 25. Years. For. The. Circulating. Supply. To. Double. 25. That’s a long time. And for it to double next time will take 50 years, and then 100 and onward.. Meanwhile, ppl loosing their wallets and increased application of the currency will double value/demand a lot sooner. Value increases faster than it decreases.  For people who say Dogecoin has ""No Cap""  Dogecoin has a cap, and that cap is 10k per block. It is not like fiat which lacks a cap because the supply can be adjusted at any point. Doge's new supply is fixed eternally at 10k per block. This amounts to 3.9% supply inflation in 2021, and every year it gets lower, but it never gets to literally 0%.  This is part of the reason Doge can make it as an option for day to day payments. If you look at Bitcoin on the other hand, it has higher fees, lower transaction speed, is far more energy demanding and doesn’t get spent because people are afraid to spend away potential profits if the coin gets even more valuable. As such, Bitcoin will do good as a value holder like gold or fine art, but you won’t pay your groceries with it. For Doge it’s the other way around. Its not realistic it will go up in the thousands. However, it might easily reach a dollar and possibly “stabilize”  somewhere around 10. Here’s one calculation to support it (albeit a bit more optimistic with 15.60)from another redditer:  adventurous_piglet85: WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE PRICE OF DOGECOIN (ANSWER PROVIDED)  So I’ve seen a variation of this question asked multiple times so I went ahead and did the literal math to calculate it out. Here’s the answer: $288.6. See below.  Question(s) Is getting Dogecoin to increase to the equivalent of one US dollar possible? Can and will it really happen? What will change if it does happen? How high can Dogecoin realistically rise in price. Market cap explanation and comparison to US currency and global FIAT currency. Yes, despite not having a fixed or capped supply, the value of the currency can rise based on its relative value against other currencies in the market. You can find examples of this in the FOREX market where currency pairs are traded, like Euro against US dollar, or US Dollar against Japanese Yen. As the value of Dogecoin rises, more and more businesses will recognise its potential and importance, and subsequently begin to accept it in exchange for goods and services. This will also help to grow the developer community around Dogecoin.  Market cap = price x supply. Price is determined by supply and demand (buying and selling of Dogecoin how much people are willing to) Supply is determined by mining Dogecoin. These two numbers can change based on market conditions. However the supply is fixed and increasing at a rate of 5,000,000,000 (approximately) per year. Current supply of Dogecoin is 128,000,000,000 (128 billion). For purposes of this explanation the rate of increase is negligible.  The current market cap of Dogecoin while writing this article is 9,000,000,000 (9 billion - early 2021). if Dogecoin was to reach $1 it would have a market cap of 128 billion dollars. Bitcoin (the most successful cryptocurrency$ currently has a market cap of approximately 700,000,000 (700 billion dollars). This means that at $1 the total supply of Dogecoin would be “worth” about 1/7th of Bitcoins total supply. The estimated supply of the US dollar is 2,000,000,000 (2 trillion) since 1 dollar = 1 dollar (LOLZ) the market cap of the US currency is 2 trillion. If Dogecoin were to reach this market cap - the price can be calculated through dividing the market cap (2 trillion) by the supply (128 billion). This means that dogecoin would equal the entire US currency at $15.60. This is definitely not impossible but highly highly improbable to ever reach this value any time soon. As in like 3-10 years away minimum. Now the entire supply of the entire worlds fiat currency is 37 trillion dollars. You can apply the same logic from above and see that the value would be $288.6. This is the theoretical limit to how much Dogecoin can be worth due simply to the fact that if it was valued at anymore than that amount it would be “worth” more than the entire world’s currencies combined which is not possible without adding more supply."

1619201278.0,2021-04-23 14:07:58,0,0,"While I understand the impetus to apply this sort of rule to a cryptocurrency and I don't think dogecoin has any intrinsic value upholding its price, it's not exactly an apples to apples comparison to say that it would have to ""overtake"" Tesla and Apple. We have to be careful in asserting these principles as fact.  Cryptoeconomics, we have learned over the last decade, requires different rules than traditional economics. Bitcoin, by all rights, should be worth less than a penny, but now it's worth tens of thousands per coin with a trillion dollar market cap. A stock's value is a share of the total value of the company. Value is an abstract concept which we use to represent some net benefit an entity has. Twitter runs at a loss and makes no profit; surely it has no value according to common sense, right?   [Twitter is valued at billions.](https://thenextweb.com/news/gsv-capital-investment-values-twitter-at-nearly-10-billion-a-figure-that-has/amp)  Why is this? Well, you can say that twitter provides a service used by so many companies that the value of it continuing to exist is staggeringly high. But to gain a more general understanding, we need to ask, **what is value?**  As defined by reinforcement learning, value is the cumulative net reward for actions taken over a series of states ordered by time. Those last two words are important - because value is time-dependent, we can never *actually* know anything's *true* value except in retrospect. However, we approximate it using heuristics that we have experimentally determined to correlate to future value.  These heuristics are ways for us to approach the abstract dynamic that drives any reward/value system.   It's important to remember: **those heuristics are just heuristics.** They may be key to the dynamic or they may simply be correlative and our data set has not yet included samples which would show that those heuristics are actually describing some other underlying principle of the dynamic.   In the stock market, many of the heuristics depend on the actions of the actors playing the game: buy/sell ratios, volume, media coverage, investor attention, etc. Market cap is one of these. It works well enough for our purposes to say that all of the value a company can possibly yield is described in its market cap. But again, **value is time-dependent and only certifiable in retrospect.** We speculate on value and call that ""price.""  The speculation itself can be part of the value - this is why BTC persists as King Crypto despite being bad, outdated tech.  Think about it like this: the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that you can't *exactly* measure an object's momentum (and therefore velocity) when measure its position. To measure velocity, you need two positions over time. If you know velocity and assume no acceleration, you can tell where an object will be *at a given time*, but not while you are measuring it.   Price and value share a similar relationship. You can't know the value until you realize it in liquidity because it is time-dependent. If you knew the true value of anything, you could play the stock market easily and become the richest person in the world. But we can't know true value, so we approximate it with heuristics and call the result a price.  All of these things are normative - they are determined by human psyche and nothing else. They may rest on objective values, but the processing of those values is 100% normative. Everyone is betting on the future, which is never perfectly knowable.   So what does this have to do with market cap?  Well, what **is** market cap for a coin? We can refer to our earlier definition - all of the value of the ~~company~~ currency combined. However, does currency really work the same way as a company? Is the price of gold really dependent on the global supply and its physical properties? No. It's shiny and people like it, so it's expensive. Gold has an $11T market cap for no reason other than it is scarce and people like it so we can impose a value system. Now reread that sentence with doge instead of gold.  If a shiny rock can have $11T market cap for no reason other than that, why *not* a currency? At what point does the market cap *actually* factor into the price calculation? The price is just the running average of recent transactions along major exchanges over time. People say a dogecoin is worth $X and it is. Where does the market cap come in?   Remember: **supply-side economics is garbage.** It is only **demand** which dictates price and nothing more.  **tl;dr** market cap may be an irrelevant measure which only serves to fuel speculation and therefore affect price  Look I'm not a doge stan; I sold mine when I could be holding $100k easily if I hadn't. Crypto is far too young a market to impose classical economics on it so strictly. We *have* to be willing to question all assumptions before they fall to the data."

1619193052.0,2021-04-23 11:50:52,0,1,s/ but there is 14.4 Dogecoins being produced in one day/ but there is 14.4 Million Dogecoins being produced in one day/

1619197529.0,2021-04-23 13:05:29,0,1,I like DOGE because it's fun to talk about and post memes on insta when it goes up and fun to meme about when it goes down... I can't lose!
1619204869.0,2021-04-23 15:07:49,0,1,"> Dogecoin would have to overtake Facebook and Tesla  If you can't see this happening I'm afraid you have a very limited imagination. They have achieved reaching new, non techy users better than any other crypto, bar perhaps Bitcoin and they seem to have unbelievable momentum right now.   It's money that's fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. Your opinions on that are your own but personally i see that as a very positive thing."

1619215880.0,2021-04-23 18:11:20,0,1,"You see that all makes so much sense. Which is why I’m so suspicious that it’ll actually abide by that logic. Crypto tends to do the opposite of what I think it’ll do, so since it does not abide by logic, then Doge WILL actually get up to $100 and beyond. That’s just the nature of this beast that knows no human logic. Whatever everyone thinks it SHOULD do, it’ll do the opposite. So if we do the opposite of that, we’ll all get rich. But what if it knows that and does the opposite of the opposite because we’re applying logic to it’s lack of logic and badixally I’ve created a warp in space-time and now in another dimension I’m a three armed warlock with ten penises and somehow 47,000,000,000 Doge is the cost of a loaf of bread there and now I need to lay down because I’m tired."

1619218707.0,2021-04-23 18:58:27,0,1,"""would have to buy dogecoin, but many people understand this is a meme coin or a pump/dump coin.""  Here is why you are completely wrong.  You are making predictions on the future based on humans all having the same understanding of what a commodity represents.  Dogecoin is a good just as bread is, economically speaking.  It's price is solely comprised on the amount that is offered and the amount that is being sold.  There have been so many bubbles in my lifetime and since i saw what Bitcoin did i don't think anybody can predict anymore what the future will bring.  And another Point to add here, many people like myself have seen the incredible story of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies and that's all we are gonna see.  We don't care if Dogecoin has a different system than Bitcoin and so could theoretically never see a similar price increase like Bitcoin, we buy the coin for 30 cents, sure it won't go to 60k like Bitcoin but make it 10 bucks and i can retire on a boat.  People don't care!  They want to buy Doge, they will.  And the more people buy, the higher the price.  I am not saying that i know what the future will hold, Doge and Bitcoin might go to 0 in a week and we all wonder how we could ever believe in something so stupid. I don't Know.  What i am saying is that you don't know either."
1619221860.0,2021-04-23 19:51:00,0,1,"I disagree with comparing crypto’s to companies... it’s not even a fair comparison. They’re so unalike and the analogy needs to stop.   With that logic you could say gold is extremely over valued, coming in at more than 11 trillion, or worth about 5 times as much as Apple... and gold has much less utility than Dogecoin or other crypto’s. There is 30 trillion worth of USD alone, and many more trillions in other fiats combined... that is a much more accurate comparison. Why? Because Dogecoin can function just the same as USD, and even as much as gold in the sense that it serves as a store of value that actually appreciates. $10 actually seems very likely once compared to fiat and rare metals which have much more in common than stocks."

1619241904.0,2021-04-24 01:25:04,1,1,"Heres where youre wrong.    1) the market cap isnt exactly the same for something like this, millions of dogecoin could simply be locked up in accounts that are lost forever, so you shouldnt be multiplying by every doge coin that exists,   2) dogecoin has no actual use, its not creating a product, its effectively a collectors item. So its better to view dogecoin the same as a player’s rookie card. A bunch of people opened some packs of cards, hit the rookie card, and basically arent selling it no matter the price.  Thus, the supply may be far lower than the market cap due to what effectively amounts to a market inefficiency and illogical owners.  Bitcoin has a “market cap” of over 1 trillion right now. But its all paper gains. 1.1 trillion dollars HAS NOT gone into buying bitcoin, and 1.1 trillion dollars WOULD NOT be earned if all the bitcoins were sold.  A very small number the people who own bitcoin would realize the gains that their statement claims they have.  Especially once the feds decide to go ahead and offload their 150k bitcoins.   I still think youre right it wont hit $10, i just think viewing something like cryptos under concepts like “market cap” isnt accurate."
1619246023.0,2021-04-24 02:33:43,1,1,"I have 25.000 doge stuck in a wallet I made in 2014 and I can't remember what my 19 year old brain thought of as a password. A month after I made the doge wallet I also made Ripple account, and found that password written down, coincidentally that password was the same one I tried for doge wallet first try, but it didn't work. Even tried cracking the password with a bunch of token words, but after 310.000 combinations, it failed.

Plus, transaction speed is much faster on DOGE, and it uses far less electricity.   &#x200B;  DOGE is a sleeping giant with a cute mascot."

Market cap is not just supply*price. There are liquidity and volume in play. Market cap in crypto doesn't mean it's easily manipulated by just pouring millions. And doge is currently 3rd/4th in volume,  the first behind ETH/BTC, which means it's just harder for doge to climb. Also since when Market cap heavily affects the price in crypto?   All that research is based on a false understanding of the crypto basics.   And there are 16k upvotes... What a clown sub."

This is true of any crypto or investment. It’s not that it will continuously do this because of course the percentages of people in each camp are going to cause a swing that creates massive movement one direction. This is something we all know. I’m not using any complex thoughts to put this idea across. This is just how humans work in markets. DOGE is already technically valued higher than tons of companies with a lot of actual business being conducted and data to back their value outside of a simple crypto price or stock price. Memes are gonna meme. It would be nice if it didn’t affect basically every other crypto out there, but that’s just proof that this is still very much the early game for crypto as a whole."

1619199889.0,2021-04-23 13:44:49,0,1,"It seems people don’t understand that somebody has to buy at x price in order for you to sell at x price. Ideally Bitcoin or Monero or something will one day be use as an actual currency with its own sort of economy in which case you wouldn’t sell on an exchange but trade your currency for some good or service( that’s why we call it cryptocurrency right??) and then your gain from buying early comes from the increase in purchasing power as the cryptocurrency economy develops, but if your goal is simply to buy back some other currency as soon as the value of the cryptocurrency has increased to whatever you wanna cash out at then you’re immediately devaluating that currency when you sell, demonstrating that nobody wants it unless they’re being fed moon-promises. Doge has little utility and so with this sort of valuation the doge market has turned into essentially a casino game in which one player bets that some other person will buy your useless shitcoin for more than what you bought in at. People also seem to forget that lying to people (telling them it will make them rich) is cheating in this casino game. I’m sure without all these moon speculators the true value of doge would be reduced to like 2015 levels when it was actually just a dumb meme coin and therefore worth literally less than a penny each."

People who are saying $10/$100 to the moon are enjoying being part of the meme coin, I hardly believe even more than a fraction of a fraction of ppl buying doge are doing it for long term investment. And the ability to make $100+ a day with it is awesome.  This post just misses the entire spirit and fun of the coin. It long winded for the *maybe* 100 ppl on this earth who are buying DOGE in that sort of thinking/fashion."

I made some sweet gains (8x and cashed out) on it, but nowhere near what I could have if I'd held until it went to .42 (100x) - TBH, because I actually understand the tokenomics of doge, I didn't think it would go anywhere near those levels any time soon which is why I got out when I did.   Lesson learned. Meme coins don't have to make ANY kind of sense to make money, quite frankly, that's the point in this case. As long as it's money i'm comfortable losing, I'm in for the ride. Still have a not insignificant but small amount that's up 6x from my last buy in, and I'll leave it there for now. It's house money anyway.   People are dumb, and if there's an opportunity to capitalize on mass stupidity to make free money, fuck it. I'm doing it"

1619205681.0,2021-04-23 15:21:21,0,1,"""Before you buy Dogecoin, you should know what you are getting. Here’s a short summary: Dogecoin has a huge supply. 129 billion coins. 10,000 coins are mined per minute. That’s 14 million new coins added to the supply every day, which adds up to about 1 billion coins added every eighty days. Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins. So, Dogecoin mints more coins every two days than Bitcoin will ever have in circulation. That’s why doge will never be priced like Bitcoin. And, in fact, at about $9 per Dogecoin, Dogecoin would equal Bitcoin in value. Dogecoin has no real ecosystem to make it valuable. It is not fast: 33 transactions per second. ETH 2.0 can handle 100,000 per second. So Dogecoin can’t serve as a currency. It seems to have minimum dev work. And it’s fueled by people who think they are getting into doge early. If you buy now, you are not. Dogecoin is not the future of anything. With Dogecoin, you are buying hype. And hype might push Dogecoin to 69 cents. Maybe to $1...but there is zero reason for doge to hold And hype might push Dogecoin to 69 cents. Maybe to $1...but there is zero reason for doge to hold that value. In fact, at $1 per Dogecoin, with 1 billion coins added every 80 days, doge would need $1 billion in new investment every few months JUST TO MAINTAIN $1.00 Also, be aware that $129 billion (doge at $1) is a huge market cap. That’s the same value as STARBUCKS. And doge has almost zero use-case scenarios. Sure you can buy some Mavs merch. Maybe find some occasional doge fans that accept it as payment. But doge can’t scale to be a currency. It’s too slow. Doge, frankly, is way overpriced right now. And Doge is going to have trouble maintaining it’s value due to its always-expanding supply. If the hype falls off just a bit—doge will fall, too. And twitter’s algorithm is heavily weighted against repeat trends. You might make money with doge, but it is far from guaranteed, and there is a fairly hard ceiling due to doge’s constant supply. If you buy doge, you are buying hype and Elon Musk tweet energy and nothing else. Be careful."""

1619210038.0,2021-04-23 16:33:58,0,1,"In terms of growth, since you seem very concerned with it, since there are 195B coins in existence and 5B produced annually, as you stated, it would take 39 years for the market cap to double, keeping price constant. This would actually solve the inflation and scalability issue.  In addition, the next doubling in cap, with price remaining constant would be 78 years later. Essentially, each time the cap were to double, with constant price, the amount of years required would double.  &#x200B;  >but Dogecoin will produce to infinity,  No it won't. You are making the assumption that time is infinite as well. For that reason, let's use a human lifespan and be generous, say 1000 years. The number of coins that would exist 1000 years from now is about 5.2T. That's a 50x increase in supply, over 1000 years.  Let's be more generous and say it's 2,000 years. The supply would be about 10.2T. What's being demonstrated is that supply doubles in the amount of time it takes for the last doubling to occur. Which scales linearly. What's more is that it takes infinitely longer to get to infinity linearly than it does exponentially. Ever heard of L'Hopitals Rule? It's applicable here where trying to determine the rates of change.  &#x200B;  Enough of the fear mongering regarding the coin supply, you don't even understand growth.  That said, aside from the growth part of your rant which I disagree with completely, it's a shit coin."

Take btc for example: market cap north of a trillion, but what happens when someone tries to sell $1 billion worth of btc? The valuation of btc falls by almost 20% from 60k to 50k. Same thing happens with stocks, when archegos was liquidated recently and the banks used bulk block trades to sell large quantities of stock such as Viacom, the value of that stock plummeted, even though nothing changed about the underlying, profitable companies.  So just because *some* doge might trade for $1 or, perhaps one day, $10, it does not follow that *all* doge will trade at that price."

With the high cost of mining, do you think the miners would somehow slow production to drive prices? I mean I wouldn’t want to mine if the reward doesn’t pay the cost and give me some profit. I would imagine the miners want the price to go up too. In my opinion (and believe me: I loved your analysis), the only way for DOGE to go passed $1 is a massive movement of more places accepting it and the miners slowing down production to keep prices up. Problem is, every time is lucrative, they will go and bump production again... The only other thing is the “meme” being used by celebrities which drives more ppl to buy it!  Again!

Nobody could have predicted a spike to .50 at that time.  So yes there wont be a natural increase to dogecoin profits but there will be variables in the market to cause spikes.  But those variables are not something you should bank on and they can work both ways.  As in the coin can tank. I would just say take this information and invest only money you can afford to lose.

1619214036.0,2021-04-23 17:40:36,0,1,"Well founded explanation.  I believe this is the type of argument most backers of traditional currency are trying to make against all Cryptocurrency, becasue they don't understand.  The claim is that there is nothing backing Crypto, so what prevents the ""rules"" from changing and the total production of any Crypto changing to infinity?  I believe Crypto is the future, however we may have not seen the final iteration yet."
1619214096.0,2021-04-23 17:41:36,0,1,At 10$ dogecoin would have roughly the same Fiat value as Bitcoin currently has. At 10$ the inflationary nature of no supply limit would represent less than 2% per year of the total FIAT value. Dogecoin can absolutely hit $10.

1619215661.0,2021-04-23 18:07:41,0,1,This is good but it’s not like the doge market cap makes any sense today. This argument would have looked the same about doge hitting 0.1 a year ago. It’s a shitcoin but the meme potential is so strong that it will inevitably boom again. Just be realistic about your chance of catching a peak.
1619215723.0,2021-04-23 18:08:43,0,1,Well said.  Personally I do the first option.  Make money while it is hype. Cos hype don't last and like we all know... Doge is an inflationary beast.  But also my portfolio is incredibly diverse. So no one thing can ever take me down.

Once you are in investment all I know (GME), proved if you supply is short and everyone buy, market adjust itself to the price. With DOGE reaching one of 10 market caps in trading it is something to think about it seriously. I know it is flamed by newcomers to market, but by all means people are choosing to invest in it short or long it is important. I have seen candle light pattern sometimes fail, while it is more accurate in real world. I don’t know, what is right or not some me not want to loose the opportunity and just want to have in their portfolio. It was just last week everyone was talking about XRP.

1619217609.0,2021-04-23 18:40:09,0,1,"THIS GUY IS USING MARKET CAP INCORRECTLY - I made another comment and a full post explaining how market cap actually works but it keeps getting flooded. Hopefully this gets more traction   First - let me clear up some misconceptions that the guy used in his post  1) Economically speaking Dogecoin can rise to whatever value the market dictates based off of supply and demand. As long as demand out paces the supply then the value will rise. - this apples to all cryptocurrency. MARKET CAP IN NO WAY DETERMINES THE PRICE OR SUPPLY. PRICE AND SUPPLY DETERMINE THE MARKET CAP.   2) Mathematically speaking market cap = price multiplied by supply MC (Market Cap) = P (Current Price) x S (Current Supply) HOWEVER - This is economics- not pure straight math. The order is important - The price or supply have to change FIRST - and THEN you get the market cap.   2) YOU CANT CHANGE ADD OR DECREASE MARKET CAP TO GET A DIFFERENT PRICE - MARKET CAP IS NOT A MANIPULATABLE value you can only change the price and supply. The price and supply change the market cap - completely different.  3) *MARKET CAP DOES NOT MEAN TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM - A 6 billion dollar market cap does not mean there’s 6 billion dollars in the system. It means that the entire supply is “worth” 6 billion at the current price. people get confused so I wanted to clarify that.  Simply adding money to the system does absolutely nothing to affect market cap in the same way it does not necessarily change the price/demand. The only two variables that change the market cap are price and supply nothing else can change the market cap.   4) People use the “unlimited supply/infinitely being mined” argument as a way of saying the supply will continue to increase and therefore the market cap will continue to decrease and therefore the price is unsustainable. That is completely incorrect - yes there are 5.25 billion per year - but when taken into perspective with fiat currency - this number is extremely small. Dogecoin is indeed inflationary, but in the span of human life, Dogecoin is not infinite. In order to have an infinite supply requires infinite time. It would take 360 years for the supply to reach 1 trillion dollars. Which is less than the total supply of the US dollars fiat paper supply - for comparison."

I also looked at the market cap and if Doge would be $2.07 it would be equal to ETH and at $7.29 it would be equal to Bit Coin.

Good objective explanation on why it’s not a good long term hold.   This applies to a lot of other crypto too, some that have real projects and tech being built. ADA will have a very small chance at reaching ETH prices because of the market cap. It would basically need to be the main global currency for that to happen.

I know that for a lot of people crypto is the new money, but the fact of the matter is that fiat money isn't subject to the same fluctuations as crypto is. With crypto, the value is determined solely by what buyers are willing to spend. While superficially it is the same with fiat, at the end of the day the nation behind a currency delivers a certain value, which is why fiat money doesn't fluctuate that much.  I'm happy for the people making money off of crypto, but I also think that people need to see it for whatnot is: a bubble you can cash in with as of now. Could he different tomorrow."

It would still take 26 years to double to coins. Currently it is at only 3.9% inflation and that will go down each year. So this doesn’t matter as much if you think about it. Yes getting to $10 is hard but if dogecoin had the market cap of btc is would be a little under $10."

1619220563.0,2021-04-23 19:29:23,0,1,"Another very important thing to remember is that market cap is not indicative of the amount of money moving around. A $40 billion dollar market cap for DOGE does not mean that $40 billion dollars has “flowed in” to DOGE. It simply means that the last traded price multiplied by the number of coins equals $40 billion.   For example, imagine that every single person held onto their DOGE for the next year. One person then breaks the line and decides to sell one DOGE for $5 to their friend. This would mean the DOGE price is $5 and the market cap would have grown to $650 billion all because of one trade for $5. In reality, obviously the number of traders is much higher but the fact remains that market cap can grow/drop by far more than the actual amount of money changing hands. This is why low volume coins can pump and drop really quickly when a big buy or sell happens.  Interestingly, the volume / market cap ratio for DOGE is pretty high at around 0.5 (it’s 0.09 for BTC and 0.2 for ETH); meaning that there actually is a significant amount of trading happening here."

I'm sure there will be another climb, and at that point I'll consider letting it go.  Either way I'll most likely sell it off or convert it into a different cryptocurrency after a certain point.

That said, I really agree that I just cannot STAND the absolute mindlessness of the people insisting the coin can go to $10, $100, $420 or whatever. These people were never around in previous years, not even in the last big bubble of 2017-2018.

1619221600.0,2021-04-23 19:46:40,0,1,"There are a lot of dumb people that buy coins based on Price and not Market-cap  For Example, let’s take the SHIBA ecosystem coins. The creator of that coin created Shiba for fun and gave it a 100 T Supply (Yes, 100 Trillion). Its insane that Shina Inu reached around 4 Billion Marketcap in less than a week. Dumb fucks were buying it up and saying $1 !   They don’t realize that they’d need a 100 Trillion Dollars. More than all the Crypto Currency and more than the Top 100 Corporations in the World combined.   The Reason that I brought up Shiba and the Shiba ecosystem was because the Creator also created another Token or Coin called LEASH (DOGE KILLER), the coin has a Total Supply of Only 100,000 so naturally, it would be expensive compared to other coins even at a Low Marketcap. At the Moment it is priced at $400 with a Marketcap of only 40 Million, but a lot of dumb people look at the price and think that its too expensive and that its too late. Why?   BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT THE MARKETCAP INSTEAD OF THE SUPPLY!   Leash would be worth $10,000 at a Marketcap of 1 Billion only  Shiba would need 100 Trillion  DOGE would need around 120-128 Billion! Let’s be realistic here.   PRICE = MARKETCAP / CIRCULATING SUPPLY !   I Have been Holding DOGE since 2017 and Holding SHIBA since it was $0.0000006. Always look at the Marketcap NOT THE PRICE.   You have to account for inflation and the increase in Supply. For Example DOGE increases by 14.4 Million a Day so that’s around 5.2 Billion Extra DOGE a year. Or around 5% Extra.   The SHIBA / LEASH example was the perfect example of how people are buying up the 3-4 Billion Marketcap coin and NOT the 30-40 Million one that has a low Supply of 100K  EDIT: I read the Title and Commented before I read your Post.

You can't get around the fact that doge is one of the most approachable coins. It may be inflationary, but so was almost literally every other currency in existence prior to 2008.   One thing that is going for doge in my eyes: If in several hundred years we are still using traditional crypto doge will look more and more appealing as even fractions as small as a few Satoshis will almost certainly be worth far too much to buy low cost items like milk and bread. Doge will not suffer this same fate. It has a different application and is far too often overlooked. The longevity of doge could even outlast bitcoin. That's not something people want to talk about because they'll probrably be long dead by then but I'm holding for the great-great-great grandkids my dude. Obviously I am holding bitcoin and other coins 'short' term too (for gainz within my lifetime) but people completely ignore the utility and I see people even saying ""doge has no utility"" that shit is plain false. Also it's almost a meaningless ammount of money right now so it's great as a ""token"" too..."

My mom bought in at 46 cents the day of her heart surgery and I told her it's a coin you have to watch closely, not a long position. Well she was comatose when she had her chance to take profit and instead now she has to figure out what a good negative return would be to dip out at.  Doge is great for active trading, no doubt.

There might be that many coins as the total supply in the wild but I seriously doubt at anyone point in time it’s ever that value for any coin due to the lost amounts and also the market cap is kind of a joke anyway, like if all of it was liquidated that’s the value?   It’s impossible to liquidate even a fraction of the total supply without impact in the market value of the coin anyway.   Supply and demand sets the value of the coin, you could be printing millions a second but if people can’t actually get it, it’s sort of like it’s not there  Edit: Another thought it’s like if a person held 20million btc and never spent it, there would only be 1 million circulating assuming everyone else spends and receives. If that one person had 200 billion bitcoin(pretend no cap here) and they never spent it it doesn’t change the market at all. it’s as if it doesn’t exist.

1619230222.0,2021-04-23 22:10:22,0,1,"I appreciate how education this is, and I do not think Doge will ever get to that level (even a $1 is stretching it) but let's step back from the science and number crunching for just a second, take a deep breath, and remember that humans are stupid animals who like to chase the shiny thing.  At it's peak, DOGE had a higher market cap than ADA and DOT. Please remember that. This was a thing that actually happened. Yes, it went down dramatically (well, everything did in the last few weeks). Doge is a joke with no future --- but it's FUNNY.   The average person is not going to care about reading a hundred page technically dense whitepaper about why VaporCoin is going to be huge in 2040 and you'll really regret not buying now!!!1. They want funny haha. In fact, I almost guarantee you that a MAJORITY (over 50%) of dogecoin holders are using Robinhood, to further drive my point home. It's accessible and funny and number go up.  No one, and I mean no one, would have ever in a million years said that Doge would have beaten ADA or DOT in marketcap and I'm not letting anyone memoryhole that. No one can say ""well actually..."" because I guarantee you're only speaking that way now because you lived through it and saw it happen. It was out of the blue. It wasn't normal. But it DID happen. So let's try to remember that numbers and analytics and all the fancy charts and graphs and metrics cannot account for average human stupidity or impulsiveness.   The point is if you're going to pull the ""but the market cap!"" card on Doge, please keep in mind that while you are correct in the long term, in the short term, novelty and hype can make prices go absolutely stupid and actual jokes can edge out the really promising projects. Something doesn't need to have potential to boom once, only demand.   This is also a cautionary tale for anyone whose nose is too far in the trees that they can't see the forest, AND anyone who thought they could buy the peak at Doge and are now suffering. Sometimes stupid shit bangs. It doesn't have to make sense. People don't make sense."

They are only worth what someone is willing to pay at the time a certain number of coins are sold.  Market cap is just used to flap your wings and say “Look at me”.

One thing no one can discount about crypto in general is that- more people are adopting. If their adoption is through DOGE, well, then it is what it is.

I ragged on doge until recently when I finally saw the writing on the wall, demand is outpacing the ridiculous supply. Its a cultural phenomenon. It won't last long and when it crashes it will crash hard. Its a pump and dump and a lot of people will get caught holding bags. It will probably take 2 more pump cycles. And a couple corrections to get near a dollar.   I predict it hits a high of 91c and then crashes in 1 hour to 5-7c. And then it will  never recover. But who knows, crazy times."

You have to explain why 35x is terrible long term investment.  You also have to explain how it peaked at that last time and this time has peaked at $0.418888 this time and how that 23x was a terrible long term investment.  As for the inflation.  That's always been there, it'is always been a thing, and it's done nothing to stop DOGE from having massive gains in the long term.  The inflation rate was why it could never get to even $0.001 cents in  2014, why it could never get to a penny, why it could never get to a nickel, why it could never get to a dime, why it could never get a quarter, why it could never get to 50 cents, and why it could never get to a dollar.  You have to explain why the inflation never prevented gains over time but now, ini 2021 it will.  Maybe it will, but you have to explain the changes that have happened to make this a key metric in stopping gains when it never has been before.  We have to explain stuff.  Not theorize, explain why left is really right and up is really down.  Some much proof about DOGE has to be kicked off with *now deny the evidence of your eyes and ears*. Long term price charts showing gains over time... those don't count.  Year-to-year analysis... no need.  DOGE hate is pure *I feel it in my gut*.  Is it the definition of ""long term""?  BTC launched in 2009.  It's 2021.  The entire space is barely 12 years old.  DOGE has been around since 2014 at least.  7 years of life in an industry that's only like 12 years old seems fairly long enough to make an evaluation of the long term value of the product.  If it's not, are we saying any project under 7 years simply.  Imo the reality is that people say it's a bad deal because it's DOGE."

Ain't no amount of math or logic gonna predict doge. Doge does what doge wants to do. These people are the same people that Said doge would never reach 10 cents. I have learned to take what people on reddit say with a grain of salt. Especially when it comes to investing. Now sure let's be realistic will doge reach 100 dollars probably not but once again we don't know its totally possible but very unlikely. Will it hit 1 dollar? I think so thats within the realm of reason so is 5 dollars and maybe even 10 dollars. I mean I could even go as far as saying doge could possibly reach litecoin prices because doge coin literally is litecoin so whats stopping it from reaching litecoin prices 🤷‍♂️ I'm not saying what this guy is saying is wrong and don't listen to him. But normally when people make post like this it's because they are trying to rationalize why they did or didn't do something and get feedback from other people to help rationalize what they did. This guy may be 100% right but just take what people say on reddit with a grain of salt.

IF that were to happen (Doge is universally used for ALL transactions) then fair value of Doge is ~$1000  To the degree that it captures less of the transactions then you scale down.  At 10% of all transactions then $100 is fair price At 1% $10 is fair price... which would put Dogecoin at parity roughly with Bitcoin on a market cap basis  Everyone misunderstands the disinflationary aspect of Doge.... the inflation rate of Doge now is less than 4% and will get smaller every year. By 2060 inflation will be less than 2%....

And protocols can easily be changed to allow for a larger supply.  Ppl saying “sell your doge!” would be the SAME ppl on early btc threads selling at 50 cents and telling everyone else to do the same. Well some hodlrs hodled out, through all the bs, and now they’re loaded.

But in, what was it? Less than 2 weeks? It went from less than $10 Billion to $55 Billion, so that’s what? $45 Billion in two weeks?  It currently oscillates around the $32 billion, so that’s still what $22 Billion that were added for its new floor to establish around the $0.25  Interesting, so based on the circulation supply of the COIN, we should be good for what? 4 years? That’s if it doesn’t raise its market cap for. Another 4 years 🧐 Yes some don’t understand market capitalization, but just like most of the people of this forum don’t understand how a digital COIN can only be a currency if it’s infinite and there’s always production of more at a fixed rate.

I can tell you why BTC is a promising and why we should invest in it but I can't exactly explain where these sudden pools of interest come from.     Over the last couple of months we've been exposed to some interesting potentials within the cryptocurrency world that could indicate that whales buying up the price are causing media hype.     It's unlike traditional investing in the aspect that most people that buy crypto just hang onto crypto. If this were traditional stock, would it go down alongside the media attention?       There are so many possibilities. I try my best to remain rational but my mind wanders. Regardless, I enjoy all of it."

1619219412.0,2021-04-23 19:10:12,1,0,It pretty much demonstrates the opposite of what he intended though.  A trillion dollar market cap is no infeasible as we’ve seen with bitcoin. And 5B more coins per year isn’t that much new supply when compared to the total number of doge in circulation.   If anything this shows $10 is reasonable.
1619226637.0,2021-04-23 21:10:37,0,0,Expect for the fact that he used market cap completely wrong. Price and supply are independent variables and market cap is a dependent variable dependent upon both price and supply and therefore you cannot mathematically say price = market cap / supply and then try to get a new price by changing the market cap. Market cap cannot be changed without changing price or supply first

1619224969.0,2021-04-23 20:42:49,0,2,"That's an inaccurate understanding of what market cap is as well.  Coins are traded on auction terms, meaning the market cap is only worked out based on the value of the last coin sold - not the totalisation of money that has flowed in to the asset (ie. As per GDP is calculated). It's entirely possible for something to have a ridiculous market cap, but be very unstable (any sales would cause it to drop significantly). The market cap can be significantly more than the money that has entered the asset space.  It only really makes sense to compare market cap to market cap for similar assets - you can't compare it to other things."

This fancy math really misses the point. Surpassing market cap is not a great comparison because it's a comparison of price TODAY to market cap TODAY. Nobody invests in DOGE because today it is $0.23 and now it is $0.23. They invest for future value. In 10 years maybe some of those top 10 companies don't even exist anymore. Maybe they're worth 500x more and today's market cap is a drop in the bucket of future cap. Overall growth of the entire economy is a rising tide that will rise all boats, err, market caps. Nobody knows but the market cap is a bad comparison because it doesn't take into account the entire purpose of investing: future value. DOGE is not a company and it does not compete with companies. DOGE could be the means of transaction of buying the goods and services of each and every one of those top 10 companies which has enormous value    OK reape it's smooth brain time again. Every investment of dramatic returns had naysayers. In an efficient market all known information is priced in very quickly and DOGE is no exception. The sheer volume of hate this coin gets is a signal to me that it's dramatically undervalued because sufficient bearish sentiment is already priced in.     I really like crayons. I'm not trying to pretend DOGE will get us lambos. I'm only suggesting that crypto elitists like their smart coins and their sheer hate of the dumb coins miss the fact that the everyperson's money is not yet in crypto. Do we really think the everyday person will use ETH to buy a tesla? Maybe! And that uncertainty is the entire point. Arrogant know it alls get slaughtered in the markets. There's a reason why most people underperform their own holdings in the market. When my mom has heard of DOGE but none of the ""smarter"" coins with higher market caps that tells me there could be a gap for DOGE to close witch means outsized returns.    **I really, really like crayons** and I'm humble enough to admit that I have no clue what will happen, but I'm willing to put my money into many dumb things to find out"

1619213973.0,2021-04-23 17:39:33,0,-3,"> Basically, all I've learned so far in my life is that nobody really knows shit. 🤷  That's just stupid. The fact is *you* don't know shit. There is a reason Governments don't just constantly print money or why printing money can ruin the value of a currency. Just because you don't expect something to happen doesn't mean people should be making investments based on crazy ""what if"" scenarios.  Just because Doge wont ever become the next BTC doesn't mean it wont have crazy swings that could make people rich if you have enough money to invest. But you would have to be investing hundreds of thousands of dollars to be making significant profit. Meaning, the only people who will make serious money on Doge swings are people who are *already rich and have money to play with and gamble for fun.* Otherwise you might make $200 or some bullshit but that's hardly anything to write home about.  Does that sound like you? Do you have $500,000 to go to the Casino and throw all on Roulette black and spin the wheel? Cause that's basically the same thing with Doge. Did you drop $1,000 on Doge? You might as well go spend that on lottery tickets.  What OP tried explaining to you smooth brained dumb dumbs is simple. The price of Doge is constantly going down and will outpace purchasing because it has infinite supply and is constantly being mined. During the rare occasions (like recently) where purchasing outpaces coin mining, prices will go up. But this is neither sustainable or likely to continue happening.  The price of Doge is constantly plummeting due to infinite supply. The only reason it will *ever* go up is because people are buying more Doge than is being created. Which is not sustainable and will eventually fall apart in the long term. The more and more Doge that gets mined, the less and less likely these big swings will become. It's far more likely that the most recent swing may be the only big swing like this to ever happen to Doge. Literally every minute, the chance of a big Doge swing is going *down* because the supply is constantly going up. Every future big swing will require more and more people to invest to make any real large swings.  The *only* reason this happened recently is because of Gamestop bringing a massive influx of new young retail investors who are actively buying ""meme"" stocks. GME is a rare bird, and Doge is a by-product of that rare bird. Right now the amount of people jumping onto the ""meme-wagon"" compared to increasing supply of Doge coins allowed for some pretty big swings in price. Not only is this not common, but it is going to become more and more difficult to achieve every minute Doge coin has more coins entering the market.  Even if every single person whose been buying these past few months stays with Doge and keeps pumping money in and out of Doge, the price is going to go down because of supply increasing constantly. You'd have to be constantly increasing the amount of people and money going into Doge to outpace the supply.  And even if you could get literally every single person on Earth to invest in Doge, the price would eventually drop off because supply would eventually become mathematically impossible to catch up with.  Unless Doge coin gets capped on supply, there is literally no way it will ever get close to BTC or anything similar. It's mathematically impossible."

But completely unpredictable and entirely based on meme-sentiment that cannot be measured or quantified in any layman sort of way.   But eventually, the supply of Doge will make price points literally impossible because there is so much doge being minted. Eventually it'll reach a point where the entire planet could be investing in Doge and the price would never reach a certain point due to infinite supply. There may be some random swings here and there as crazy meme-interest peaks in Doge but every single minute the chance of such swings is plummeting.  Nobody can predict something like this happening. But the *only* reason it happened is because GME happened. GME brought in a ton of new investors via Robinhood and other apps. We're talking 18 year olds who just blew their last paycheck on Doge coin instead of video games because they rolled with some memes on reddit. The only reason these investors bothered is because all the insanity surrounding GME. There is no way to predict that happening. And every second it becomes more and more unlikely to happen again. Eventually it will become literally impossible.  Infinite supply will eventually run rampant. Sooner or later it'll become mathematically impossible to increase the price of Doge past a certain point no matter how many people are investing.  So yeah, maybe you'll get lucky tomorrow and 100% of the planet will put some money into Doge. In the short term, something crazy might happen. You could also buy a lottery ticket tomorrow and be a millionaire.  But for these big swings, you'll need more and more money getting pumped into Doge, and every minute Doge gets mined the amount of money/people investing will need to increase well beyond any regular stock.  Is it impossible for that to happen in the short term? No. But significantly unlikely and increasingly more unlikely leading to eventually impossible."

Meme related coins can certainly rocket off but what I would worry about is that it will just start losing popularity. Since dogecoin doesn’t have any applications like ETH or something, it might just lose attention of people. Even people who are very hyped up about it might also just lose interest eventually.   I guess I wonder if it’s *reasonable* to assume that we’ll continue to see increases in the hype and currency due to it. Everyone invests in dogecoin for profit, so what happens when other ventures are becoming far more profitable?  I’d still argue that doge is a better short term investment; not to say it *can’t* grow, but that I view it as unlikely to reach these values people talk about due to the timing aspects of it.  Idk, thoughts? Just a conjecture I might be completely off here"

1619218454.0,2021-04-23 18:54:14,1,1,Bitcoin has a cap though.
1619221028.0,2021-04-23 19:37:08,1,1,"The math on this is crazy simple, but I’ll do the work for you since I’m bored lol. There are 21 million bitcoins currently in the market (supply). That’s the denominator in your equation. Supposedly there’s a 23 million cap. Then, what I assume you’re curious about is different price inputs and what that would do to the market cap overall.   Simple math allows us to multiply the denominator by both sides to get the same equation in a different format: (Price)*(Total Coin Supply) = Market Cap.  So let’s say the price is $1M coin. All you do then is a little substitution. ($1M)*(21M Coins) = $21 Trillion Market Cap.  In all the articles I’ve read so far, the craziest number I’ve seen estimated as a potential number for Bitcoin to hit is $500k per coin. So since $500k is half of a million, you’d just cut the number we arrived at before in half to arrive at $10.5 Trillion Market Cap, which would still be 5x the size of Apple.  But like I said before, there’s potential for there to be 2 million more bitcoins in existence, so when those extra 2 million are added to the supply, that would dilute any number you come up with by about 9%.  So roughly speaking, you could just multiply each number you come up with by 0.91 to come up with the diluted figure. So if you owned 1 coin today at roughly $50K per coin, if the other 2 million bitcoins instantly hit the market you, can expect the value of your Bitcoin to be ($50K)*(0.91) = $45,500, all else equal."

1619227084.0,2021-04-23 21:18:04,1,0,Expect for the fact that he used market cap completely wrong. Price and supply are independent variables and market cap is a dependent variable dependent upon both price and supply and therefore you cannot mathematically say price = market cap / supply and then try to get a new price by changing the market cap. Market cap cannot be changed without changing price or supply first

Even ppl who genuinely don’t think it’s a good long term investment are ridiculing those who openly state they’re in it for the short term (as if everyone isn’t actually in all this to make money at the end of the day).   It’s also annoying when the 5 billion in extra coin a year is constantly brought up without providing fair context to the concept of a fixed amount becoming proportionally smaller to the entire pool each year.

1619252177.0,2021-04-24 04:16:17,0,1,"This post gets it all wrong. First of all: ""It's just a meme coin."" And? Does that mean it doesn't exist? What is this argument supposed to mean? ""It's a pump n dump coin."" That was only true for Dogecoin before it had the value that it currently has. Basically, it's easier to pump and dump coins of low value which is what Doge had a few years ago, but now it's getting too big for it to be pumped and dumped predictably by a few people. It has had a history of being pumped and dumped several years ago, and they can try again, but they won't make all that big of a profit this time which means it won't be as worth it. As the market value of a coin goes up, the harder it is for it to be pumped and dumped. That means that argument is outdated for Doge.  Speaking of market cap, this guy seems to think that the market cap is just the total amount of face value money that people put in it. The market price accounts for money put in at face value along with existing money that has gone up in value. While putting money into a crypto increases its value and vice versa, there are other factors at play here. It's hard to explain all the forces at play that make a crypto valuable (such as utility), but it's obvious that the recent dip in ALL the cryptos that have occurred at the same rate would not be from people pulling out money at said steady rate which is apparently what this guy thinks is the only determining factor in a crypto's value. I know I'm not fully knowledgeable on that subject, but this guy is even less so.  On another note, ""Doge would have to reach 1.29 trillion to reach $10."" Yeah, that's not going to happen suddenly, but don't act like cryptos being worth that much is an impossible thing. Bitcoin had a trillion before the recent dip.  This is just another dump ape's perspective, but people here need to stop thinking of themselves as not being dump apes either."

Maybe after the last BTC is mined, then BTC can become deflationary.  It would do this as people lost access to their BTC or BTc got burned somehow.   Doge is inflationary FOREVER.  The circulating supply will be inflated by 10k coins every MINUTE, Forever!  So as long as time is elapsing, doge is inflating"

The satoshi argument does not apply because it is a zenos paradox. There code only allows for 16 decimal places of satoshi - therefore really you can use whatever units you want and change bitcoin to satoshi, but there are still 18 million bitcoin.

1619240344.0,2021-04-24 00:59:04,0,1,"The author of that post misleads people.   Cryptos Market cap is not just supply*price. There r also volume and liquidity in the game. Also supply of 5b a year is not much considering how high volume of Dogecoin is. It's currently the highest after ETH/BTC(top5 crypto for sure). Hence supply just makes it harder to grow, but popularity of Dogecoin holds it just fine. Market cap can also do little to the price.   ETH is pretty much about utility that is why it's not just a brand. Dogecoin doesn't have that kind of utility, but it does offer low fees and is also fast. NewEgg has recently accepted it as a payment option and that is just another example of its utility.   In conclusion, Dogecoin is extremely popular and its high volume shows there is a comfortable journey to $1. Reaching 100-130b market cap with the current supply is absolutely possible. In fact it's only a matter of time. How high can dodge go? Well realistically speaking it cannot surpass BTC or ETH market cap, but going to 100b and beyond is inevitable (not that it means much but it surely means a lot to you)"

1619262429.0,2021-04-24 07:07:09,0,1,"The problem is that market cap is a deceptive metric. The way the person who wrote this post is thinking, it would mean that the rise of Doge from 20 cents to 40 cents meant there was an influx of $500+ billion in like a day’s time.  That’s not at all what happened.   A huge chunk of Doge is owned by a small number of people who are holding. And beyond that a lot of the people who own small amounts are also holding.   What drove the price up to 40 cents was that the pool of people willing to sell at 20 cents was just not large enough to accommodate those wanting to buy at that price.   In other words, if the available supply and demand ratio for Doge could cause it to spike to 40 cents in such a short period of time it can easily drive it to $10 in the coming months. So you’d better buy some Doge when you have the chance!"

People see BTC and think it’s too late to get in (it’s so not), and then they see little DOGE that influencers and the news are drooling over. It’s cheap and hyped to the gills toward the financially downtrodden masses who are simply looking for hope, some light at the end of the tunnel. Add in the Wallstreetbets saga, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster.   I was like this during the dot-com bubble. I had it all figured out. I already had my riches spent in my head. So many grandiose plans. When it all fell apart, I felt like dying. My stomach hurt for weeks. I felt so much shame. I don’t wish that on anyone.  Please, folks. Don’t overdo it.

It however does not exceed the ammount of money printed by even 1 major country a day.   With more and more businesses moving to crypto, I can see doge becoming a staple of online sales in the next 10 years.   I think that once people relize this it will rocket to $150 due to a huge short squeeze then plummet down to $3-4 where it will remain and adjust with inflation over time.   The reason it has potential to replace normal currency is that it is infinite, but still limited in production, allowing it to be replaced if lost, but still hold an exchange value."

I dig that the market cap can certainly grow in the future, it's all up to the people. The math is just pointing out the relative probability of something happening in a future that no one can surely predict. The math is saying that it's highly unlikely that doge can or will break $10+, but that's not to say it won't - it's just a really safe bet against. The thing about doge is that it is driven by meme (and word of mouth). It's not reasonable that people continue to buy doge, it goes against logic, but so far this year, they've destroyed the barrier of ATH twice and a couple months back when it was nearing 10c, I figured due to the market cap, doge wouldn't get anywhere near $1. I've changed my perspective to think that it probably could get $1-2, maybe even this year if Elon keeps tweeting and the media keeps covering it.  I did see an interesting post on the front page yesterday talking about the importance of whales, and how they can be overlooked, in this space. Potentially, greater minds than ours are pulling the strings on all of the top coins, inflating their own wallets while we struggle over their leftovers. They can cause crashes on purpose, or start buying frenzies. That definitely will factor into the future. But that's just my speculation anyway. We'll all bet on various coins, some people will die on their hills and some will make it out better off."

1619200849.0,2021-04-23 14:00:49,1,1,It’s absolutely unrealistic.  Doge would have to be 10 times as valuable as bitcoin for this to happen.

1619203382.0,2021-04-23 14:43:02,2,2,"Well - this is my thought on it - yes there’s a lot of people trying to look for immediate profit - there are also a lot of meme coins. The difference between those and Dogecoin is that Dogecoin has proven track record of 8 years of success- even if the price per coin didn’t necessarily reflect that for a long time. These other meme coins are usually deFi tokens with burn mechanics meant to artificially drive the price. Dogecoin is meant to be spent. Dogecoin is accepted by more than 99% of other cryptocurrency. Based on this track record and utility I personally don’t see Dogecoin going away, although the hype may indeed fade"

You can only use up to .0........1 (16 out) Therefore you can use sataoshis all you want it doesn’t change the fact there’s only 18 million bitcoins.
1619198461.0,2021-04-23 13:21:01,5,21,Can I ask a dumb question as a newbie?  Who is making Dogecoins and why don’t they stop?
1619199548.0,2021-04-23 13:39:08,0,5,"Market Cap is not an end all metric, but if you also consider volume, it’s pretty informative.   Meaning: if there’s only $100 a day of doge being exchanged, then it’s a very small volume and not representative of the actual value of doge. A handful of people could easily manipulate the price and thus market cap to be higher or lower.   When the volume is massive though (say 100m a day), like it is now, then market cap more or less represents the value through the eyes of millions of people and thus it’s much more accurate.  I think dismissing it as a useful metric is silly, you just need to look at some additional info to validate it before making any takeaways."
1619208152.0,2021-04-23 16:02:32,0,1,"Market cap is a calculation. It's supply x price.   The reason it's a big deal with doge is because of the number of new coins created. Remember when it was a big deal that Tesla invested $1.5 billion into Bitcoin. That's more than Tesla's 2020 profit of 721 million.  So, doge mints 10,000 coin per hour. That's 14.4 million per day. 1 billion new coins every 70 days.   So, if doge were to reach $1, it would need $1 billion in new investment every 70 days just to maintain its value.   It's a very valid argument against doge rising above or even maintaining a value at $1."
1619191693.0,2021-04-23 11:28:13,2,55,"The people buying this coin do not know anything about the supply problems. They are not buying it for it scarcity. They are buying it at $0.30 because they believe it will go to 60 cents. It doesn't matter if you have a trillion of these coins or only 10,000 of these coins. All they want to do is make a profit and in that situation, with an asset that cannot be valued in the same way a company can be valued, the value is only what someone is willing to pay for it.  Edit: typos."
1619197501.0,2021-04-23 13:05:01,5,20,"I did the math and if everyone holds for 1 year, the 5 billion new coin will drop the price about 1 cent. In fact, every year if the same amount of coin is produced, then the drop will be less dramatic. I don't know enough about Doge to say what the future coin numbers will be, but theoretically price isn't affected as much as people think by new coin. It is more buyer/seller demand which ultimately dictates price. Will the coin be useful in the future?"
1619218058.0,2021-04-23 18:47:38,0,1,"At the current supply of 129 billion coins doubling the supply and therefore dropping the price by 50% would take at a rate of 14.4 million  dogecoin/day almost 25 years  After that it would take 50 years to double the supply again, so adding 14.4 million doge/day for 75 years would drop the price by 75%, and then it would take 100 years (175 years from now) to double the supply a third time"
1619224499.0,2021-04-23 20:34:59,0,1,"If everyone stopped purchasing a coin the price would stagnate and stay exactly the same!   Say there is 1000 coins  If $1000 were put into this coin when the price is set at its low then after the purchase the asset would be worth $1000.  The price wouldn't go down if no one else bought into the crypto.   The reason Doge is a bad long term invesment is due to its inflationary nature. So if trading halted completely and everyone has diamond hands, the constant supply of doge would dilute the market cap and it would passively lose value due to an ever increasing supply."
1619193515.0,2021-04-23 11:58:35,1,15,"It's still a good metric for quickly evaluating what the total amount of what something would be worth, given it's current price (which would obviously change the moment someone starts buying or selling)  Yeah it's not exact and it's not necessarily a great metric in strict terms, but it's definitely useful to compare things at a glance"
1619198605.0,2021-04-23 13:23:25,0,1,"How is it a stupid metric ?  If the price is 0.30 cents. To keep it at 30 cents given the current supply production, approximately 2.5 billion dollars will have be pumped for the buy at 0.50 cents every year. Otherwise, the supply will be greater than the demand. Therefore drop in price.   Now assume the price target is 5 dollars. That means you're expecting that yearly , you'd add $25bn of liquidity to this coin to support it at 5 dollars.   The main reason why the USD treasury interest rates are negative is because the supply is endless and there's no backing it. Why wouldn't the same be the case for doge then ?"

1619218293.0,2021-04-23 18:51:33,1,2,"""market cap is a construct"" is easily the silliest thing I have ever read in fourish years of being heavily in crypto. I often see people throwing out any sort of argument to support whatever they think is good and will bring them value. These are also the people that buy at highs and sell at major losses only to buy back in at an even higher price. Emotions and saying stuff doesn't exist because it does not go with your point of view is not a wise way to approach a market that has real and actual potential to financially devastate you if you aren't careful. I'm not worried about what makes a profit in a bull markets. Hell, most coins you could have turned a huge profit if you started buying back last year. I'm looking for stuff that will last and has a reason beyond just buying and selling things because you can do that with pretty much any coin out there. Make a short term profit with doge coin sure, but when the bulls fall asleep there is nothing that could ever convince me to hold doge long term"

1619214614.0,2021-04-23 17:50:14,0,3,"There's a bigger conversation to have about bitcoin's finite supply to be honest. The last bitcoin mined will be in 2140, way after you'll be dead. There's 2.5 million bitcoins left to mine. If you want to cash out within the next 20 years, you'll be seeing like 1.8 million bitcoins mined in that time, a current value of about $90 billion in bitcoins mined.  Meanwhile doge has a constant 10k doge mined per minute, that's 1.44 million doge per day, or 525 million doge per year. Over 20 years that's 20 billion doge. At the current price, it's $6 billion in dogecoin mined.  We could even expand it to 2140, and pretend that all the 2.5 million bitcoins have been mined, that's $125 billion in bitcoin mined, yet in 120 years only $36 billion in doge will be mined. It will take dogecoin 400 years to catch up to the amount of bitcoin minted at current prices. I don't know how long term you're thinking about holding, but I think the unlimited minting is a non-issue, if anything doge will mint less money than bitcoin in your lifetime."

Of course there will never be 2.6b people investing 1000$, it was just an utopian example.

If the US dollar sees greater inflation (which it almost certainly will after we printed one of every four dollars ever or something like that last year) then it will be deflationary much more quickly. It's already less than 5% annual supply inflation.  The finite amount of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will actually be a problem for mass adoption as an actual currency. No national currency in the world has a fixed, finite supply that I know of.  Your post completely ignores inflation."

DOGE at $1 would give it \~$130b market cap, seems reasonable, relatively speaking. $10 or $100 seems like a stretch but at the same time hard to say it's absurd with everything that's going it's like the cat calling the kettle black.  Note there is \~$30T+ USD circulating. These are intended to be currencies not companies providing value. I believe the marketcap should be derived based on adoption/usage across numerous sectors of the online community. Doge being used as an e-commerce currency could be good thing. BTC could potentially serve as medium/store of larger value.  Another point to consider, there is good/bad inflation just like there is good/bad deflation (you should look into that more). Inflation is arguably a necessary characteristic of healthy currency associated with healthy economic growth and innovation."

Creator of this posted manipulated the numbers to mislead.   The author suggested some insane market cap numbers for a manipulation. High volume and liquid market play far more important role for manipulation of the price.   Rapidly growing price doesn't mean everyone will be willing to trade certain currency at a higher price when it settles down(that willingness depends on hype, news, currenct crypto market situation etc). Had market cap shown some crazy numbers(cuz of price skyrocket) it wouldn't mean much for the future. It's just a current situation indicator.   In a high-volume situation you can't manipulate the price unless a lot of money is involved(either a really big whale, or most people buying). High volume of a currency and a skyrocketing graph make it a good investment."

That’s much higher than Dogecoin circulation of about 1.2 billion currently. If Dogecoin mining were to be halted completely right now, we’d likely see a huge gain in the currency’s price. That could be good for some, bad for others. The reason Bitcoin is as expensive as it is, is because it resembles Gold, in how there’s now a limited supply of it. It’s not infinite.   Right now, USD and Dogecoin have recurring circulation in common. While I do believe in the future of it, Dogecoin mining will have to be lowered if possible in order to see higher gains in the price of a Dogecoin. Right now, where just at the beginning of retailers and businesses accepting Dogecoin as currency. That number is highly likely to increase in the next couple of months to a couple years out.   USD is simply printed. That’s where all the stimulus checks come from. Who knows truly how much USD is out there and printed, and printed, and printed. But I do know that the number is much higher than Dogecoins circulation.   Which leads me to this basic human theory conclusion. In the most basic thought of man,   If there is less of something, it’s more valuable, or soon will be.   If there’s more of something, the price will either sit stagnant or go down.   USD circulation= 1.2 Trillion Dogecoin Circulation= 120 Billion  These are estimated numbers, not exact."

1619279301.0,2021-04-24 11:48:21,0,1,"Look, I think you're upset because you don't know what I'm saying, let me try to explain it more thoroughly.  If you have 1000 doge coins, you didn't spend a lot of money for it.  If it hits 1 dollar you're done amazingly and you can either sell it for profit, or hold it and use it as ACTUAL currency on the websites that have added that option.  So in terms of practically you can literally buy things with it.    You'll basically never have to worry about whether you  ""should've waited for it to hit 50,000 dollars"" we've all got that one friend who had 100 bitcoin years and years ago and sold it to pay for a used car they really needed at the time.  Doge simply cannot get to that value.  And further more, I will never have to worry about my one doge coin losing me 15,000 dollars in a week.  Coin price absolutely affects practicality.  Why would a website want to accept payments with a coin that can lose 10s of thousands of dollars of value in weeks or months.  I understand the ability to pay with fractions of a coin but people aren't going to want to do that, so businesses won't accept it.  Basically, I am saying if you're buying bitcoin because you want to use it as currency you're wasting your time and money.  I'm just a guy at business school who has already spend 16 years in the work force before college.  I've managed grocery stores, I've worked all over the place in a number of fields, and I've met 10s of thousands of customers of all types of financial levels and I'm just speaking from my personal experience, but my experience is worth something.

1619208540.0,2021-04-23 16:09:00,1,2,"> You’re wrong. DOGE decreases in supply.  Im sorry you are wrong.  The supply (the amount that exists) increases every minute with 10k doge.  The only way in which a coin can have its supply decrease is through coin burns, or people losing their keys, BTC has a burn address, I think a project called counter party burned like 3000 BTC.  That was a decrease in supply.   Doge's supply will INCREASE (10k doge are added every minute)  forever.  As long as doge exist, its supply will be getting bigger.  Every minute, there will be 10k doge ADDED to the current supply.  Can you understand basic concepts of math ?  There is  128 billion doge (the current supply).  1 minute later there will be 10k more.  Then 2 minutes later, 10k more.  and so on forever. 10k doge every minute.  The supply increases, thus the supply is inflationary.  how is this debatable ?  Sure the rate at which it inflates is less every year, but doge will always be inflationary, even if that rate of inflation is 4% or .04%.  Its still inflationary and will be forever"

My reasoning is this: I honestly think that crypto is about to explode this year and next, all the red flags of the centralized banking system are flying high, and more and more people are realizing it. Institutional investors are jumping in in a way not seen before, and it won’t go backwards now. Once the sleepy normies start waking up in droves, I really do think the dawn of crypto finance is almost upon us. Once that happens, everything changes.

The value, or the price as decided by fundamental value rather than hype, will be a consequence of how much money is invested divided by how many coins there are, as op explains. More money invested makes each coin worth more, while more coins divide up that that investment to smaller pieces and lower the price or value. So when people are talking about increasing the price, that requires a proportional daily spend into doge to maintain that price or else it will just be a temporary peak.   For the fabled $100 dogecoin, that would require $1.4b every single day to maintain that price. For even just $1, that's $14.4m per day. That might seem achievable spread across a large population, but when you get realistic about how many are participating and how much those people can or are willing to sustain in perpetuity, even that becomes a stretch. More realistically doge either dies off for money making purposes or holds at a couple cents. The fact that it can't get more than about 50 cents at peak hype just goes to show the investment just isn't there, and so significant sustained investment is unlikely.   Btw calculations above were just for maintaining price. To actually build up to those points would require enormous lump sums to drive it up in the first place."

Especially because this type of bullshit pump and dump scheme will likely bring regulations that hurt the entire crypto space, and for what?

The design of the coin is such that 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE and anything else is wishful thinking.  Utilizing DOGE as anything other than a quick short easy way to make some gains is frankly irresponsible.

I have 0 regrets about not buying a super centralized manipulated shitcoin, I just fear for those that bought on at 40 cents with more that they can afford to lose.   Some doge holders are smart, they saw the meme potential and went eh it's worth a shot. If you bought after the pump (8 cents) I think you're an idiot even tho it somehow went even past that. If you bought at 40 cents you're actually an idiot lol. If you bought back in the day cause it actually was cheap (low marketcap) then I think that was a reasonable play assuming you didn't go all in lol. Legit no disrespect if you actually got in early, but buying at the top of a bubble? For a shitcoin with no real future other than being a meme? Just so dumb.   I don't think people that hodl doge are stupid because I'm salty I missed out, I think it's just a dumb bet. And it's so big now it has less room to grow than other shitcoins, it was at like 50b marketcap. It's not gonna 10x to half of btc value anytime soon, it's frankly just a silly bet, I ain't gonna feel bad I didn't gamble on a dumb decision that happened to work out because Elon musk and market manipulation lol. Doge is so centralized, top 10 holders own like 50% or some crazy shit, it's all hot air.   To recap, I think people that hold doge are dumb cause it's just a dumb play, not cause I'm sad I missed out (at this price, if you bought it earlier as a joke, no disrespect. If you fomo in, I'm sorry but you kinda deserve to lose your money).   What gets me is they think it's not a shitcoin. I own shitcoins, I made a lot off safemoon but I ain't about to say safemoon isn't a shitcoin Ponzi lmfao, I'm at least aware I'm ""investing"" (gambling) on garbage, that's what bothers me about doge. And I sold 95% at the top instead of holding for 1000x gains, I took my 35x and was real happy with the win!  It ain't investing to buy doge at 8 cents (somehow worked out, congrats) or especially 40 cents, it's gambling because of fomo.   Tl;Dr doge is a shit investment not cause I'm mad I ""missed out"", it's a fun memecoin to throw 5% into or some shit, not go all in as actually your entire portfolio stocks and crypto! It's so crazy to me is all. The doge community is one of the most uninformed groups on the blockchin in general, on what a marketcap is, why is doge ""so cheap"" when it's crazy overvalued, and how these people are actually convincing themselves it's a long term investment.    I saw an article of a guy who slammed in 180k into doge, rode it to a million and didn't sell cause he wants 10m. Not a single doge sold, not even his cost basis. It's just unadulterated gambling and thank God for him he's probably still up, just way less."

The point of Doge is to spend it at retailers, not to own as an investment.  Investing in Doge is as silly as ""investing in the Euro"".  The ""Market cap"" of a nation's currency isn't tied to anything useful, its only concern is ""how much stuff can I buy with a Euro"".  So, is the ""market cap"" of the Canadian dollar worth more than Apple or Tesla?    The correct answer is ""who cares, that's not why people value the canadian dollar"".  The Canadian dollar is compared to the US dollar, just as DOGE is compared to the US dollar:   To determine the price of a banana.  Not to say ""How much profit would I make by selling my CDN for USD today vs. 10 years from now"".   I'm holding DOGE so I can use it on Crunchyroll, Newegg, Netflix, etc.   That's what it's for, not as an 'investment'.  It's a currency, not a stock.    The more retailers accept it, the more internet memes and hype and adoption, the more stable the price.  And if more get printed every year (about 4%-5% inflation, in line with various nation's currencies), that's good for the currency the same reason it's good for the US dollar or Canadian dollar."

1619203002.0,2021-04-23 14:36:42,1,2,Market cap is used for companies since there is actually something of tangible value when it comes to a company. It could be just a combination of the assets and debts or it could also be their profits and future profits that are considered when evaluation of a company is made by those who try to determine what would the value of an individual stock and if it is overvalued or undervalued and a good thing to own.  With currency it makes absolutely no sense. The global money supply of US dollars do not represent the GDP of the nation or the total amount of assets owned by Americans or anything else. The only thing that matters when it comes to currency is what $1 can buy you. Whether what $1 can buy you is stable or increasing or decreasing will depend on whether you want to hold it get more of it or get rid of it for a different currency or different asset. The market cap of currency has absolutely no sensible connection to anything.  So is cryptocurrency a currency or an asset? If it's a currency used to buy things as Bitcoin purported to initially be then there's no purpose to market cap. All that matters is what one Bitcoin can buy you.   If it is an asset then again market cop has no purpose because nobody cares what is the market cap of all Bugattis they just care what one Bugatti is worth because you only likely care to buy one.   If Bitcoin is like gold then what is the market cap of gold? And why does that even matter? The only thing matters is the value of gold increasing decreasing or remaining the same. It could have a market cap for all gold of a million dollars or 100 trillion dollars and it wouldn't make a lick of difference to the person buying 1 oz of gold because they are buying it if they believe the price is stable or going up.

1619213926.0,2021-04-23 17:38:46,1,0,"Here, you are so lazy I will paste it for ya. You have massive misconceptions of how DOGE works.  Q: Does DOGE have a fixed supply? Does DOGE have a “cap”? Does DOGE have a “hard cap”? A: Yes, DOGE has a fixed supply of 10,000 coins per block. Yes, there is a “cap” on how many DOGE will exist at any given time. No, DOGE does not have a “hard cap” because there will never be a day when no more DOGE is issued.  Bitcoin does have a hard cap, which means its supply increase (""inflation"") will go to 0% after 2140. DOGE’s supply increase is 3.94% in 2021 and it falls every year and over a very long period of time will eventually get arbitrarily low (e.g. 0.00000000000000000001%) but will never reach exactly 0%.  Three of the best well-known cryptocurrencies have selected different solutions - Bitcoin has a fixed supply, and a hard cap. - Dogecoin has a fixed supply, but no hard cap. - Ethereum has an unfixed supply, and no hard cap.  Nobody knows which solution is best, but we think it is smart to keep minting some coins each year, because some coins are always lost from circulation, and we want to encourage people to spend coins and not hoard them.  Q: Does this mean “unlimited” or “infinite” DOGE can exist at any time? A: No. Here we hand over to Dogecoin Developer /u/patricklodder, who writes  The fallacy in the ""unlimited coin theory"" is this:  Time is unlimited Dogecoin issues a predefined amount of new coin over time Therefore, there are unlimited coins. This is correct. But now:  At any point in time, the value of dogecoin will drop, because there are unlimited coins. This is false, because at any point in time, there is still a limit to the amount of DOGE. Only if you look over infinite time, is there infinite DOGE.  Imagine you make $30 per hour at a 9am-5pm job. If someone asks you how much money you make, would you say “I actually make infinite dollars, because if you assume I live forever I would never stop making money”? No, you would say “I make $30 an hour” or “I make $62,000 per year”.  Similarly, if someone asks about DOGE 'inflation', you should say “Doge supply increase is currently 3.94% per year, and it gets lower every year”.  Q: I heard that 10,000 DOGE are minted every minute. Isn’t that a lot of DOGE? A: At first it sounds like a big number, given Bitcoin only mints 96,162 Bitcoins per year. But did you know Bitcoin minted 96,162,000,000,000 Satoshis in 2020? Changing the base unit can make a dramatic shift in how large the supply increase seems to be. However, it only makes sense to consider the percentage supply increase per year. The raw units do not allow any basis for comparison between coins, because every crypto denominates their coins differently.  Q: OK, if we should consider percentage supply increase, what is DOGE’s percentage supply increase? A: Here is the total number of Dogecoins available at the end of each year of its existence, and the percentage change year on year.  End 2013: 18,211,323,904 Dogecoins in circulation End 2014: 97,204,400,153 (+434.8% increase in supply) End 2015: 102,460,278,024 (+5.41% increase in supply) End 2016: 107,529,653,033 (+4.95% increase in supply) End 2017: 112,578,744,538 (+4.70% increase in supply) End 2018: 117,640,040,831 (+4.50% increase in supply) End 2019: 122,701,414,426 (+4.30% increase in supply) End 2020: 127,748,316,518 (+4.11% increase in supply)  There is estimated to be 3.94% supply increase in 2021. 2022 will be even lower, and 2023 lower still, and so on forever."

1619209153.0,2021-04-23 16:19:13,0,1," but for the sake of a proper explanation we have to differentiate here:  Forex as in the foreign money exchange is just a financial market. It operates decentralised for very good reasons but as a consequence of that regulators have just recently caught up to bring more transparency to the market (like the FX code of conduct). It is not a scam, of course not, but it needs improvement.  When most people talk about the Forex scam they talk about retail Forex. Even here though, it is certainly not a scam BUT:  Many people see the financial markets as a casino. Retail Forex has the lowest entry barrier which should be a good thing, but it tends to attract people for all the wrong reasons: becoming rich very fast, turn small amounts of money into huge sums.  All these people who are attracted by that and the advertising around that attracts shady businessmen to operate scam brokers and it certainly puts off more serious people. The huge difference between winners and losers is a consequence of that. The advertising by SOME businesses in the retail FX scene is beyond belief: Fast cars, half-naked ladies, big stacks of bank notes, 1000:1 leverage … Compare that to a website of a stocks brokers and it is no surprise that people talk about a Forex scam.  As a little advice:  I’ve been trading currencies for several years. I used to run my own business, I’ll never go back there. I’m happy with trading a few hours a day, I usually make more than enough to comfortably live off (even in rather expensive London). I got here by ignoring, not by following every promise I could. I don’t care for trading robots, magic money maker fortune teller indicators, those brokers with shady advertising (and a likely matching business morale), signal services. I learned the basics, I learned how to read a candlestick chart and about support/resistance, ranges, channels, reversal signals, volatility, liquidity and all these boring things (or at least I guess they would be boring for most, I’m attracted by logic and inner workings).  You crytop geeks know nothing about how the markets work, your all just trying to ""Get Rich quick""     So calling the world's largest market a scam just shows how little you know. Goodbye"

You know the people minting this trainwreck are taking fiat from you i.e they are happy to give you a doggie coin in exchange for real money.

1619209067.0,2021-04-23 16:17:47,0,7,"You are misunderstanding my point I think. I am claiming that the only way to judge whether some blockchain **maybe** has potential, is by looking at the technology. So, if you want to make money, long term, this is what you should be looking at. And anybody who thinks DOGE has anything to offer in that regard is unfortunately mistaken.  Maybe the hype will get DOGE to $1. Probably it won't. But I'm open to the possibility. Even if it does, it doesn't matter, because a lot of the people will not sell out at that point, even if they promised themselves they would before. When the market is climbing most people don't want to sell. *What if it goes further up?* Then there is a dip: *Well, it's just a small correction*. *It will recover*. It goes down more. *Can't sell now, we were already at $1 and would lose out on so much profit.* And so forth and so on.  What drives the price, long term? It's adoption. Development. Use cases. Solving real world problems. This is why people got excited about blockchain in the first place. If you want to make money you need to try to see the big picture.  Or just hope to get lucky. But in that case, you might as well go gamble it all away in a casino. There is no free lunch.  I would suggest some reading.

You can take bets on stocks of course the same as gambling, but if you do it the Buffet way, you’re looking to invest long term.  My current burning question is: what would it take to get Buffet and Munger to change their minds on crypto? Their passionate dislike for it is that it doesn’t produce anything."

Nobody thought that BTC would rise up so quickly after having been mostly dormant for years.   Long term price targets might carry some weight. You can estimate how much market share ETH for example could take away from corporations that do things that ETH promises to do in the future. Or you can estimate who much money will flow from gold to BTC as a store of value. But even these estimates are vague at best.  Don't believe anybody who tries to tell you that doge has the potential to go up to amount $X. They don't know. Nobody does.  &#x200B;  > but after that the value is determined solely by how much the buyers think it will be worth in the future.   And what do you think determines what buyers think it will be worth in the future? Whether the picture on the coin is funny? Ttechnology does drive the price, in the long term. In the short term this is distorted by hype and wanting to get rich quick. But this fades.   It's the same way in the stock market. Growth sustained by increased productivity will last.

When money is created through a loan (what banks do), it's automatically expecting more money back than it initially put in the market, so debt is already higher than circulating money upon creation.  How I read your comment is that this debt is basically ""backed"" on the other side by underlying value that it creates (utility). But whatever money is used to pay the interest, that money is already once created with also a debt. So there is never a way to pay the total debt in money. And I don't think all utility in the world could ever back it up either, because not all utility keeps it's value. Once you burned gas, its burned, gone."

That’s good for you, genuinely. But you’re not the one giving shade and hate to people (from what I can see anyway). I’m just saying a lot of those who are being dicks are the ones who are secretly jealous.  > I just fear for those that bought on at 40 cents with more that they can afford to lose.  Why? With the greatest of respect, they don’t give a shit about you or your opinion, so why waste your energy being worried for them? It only taxes you. Also, *anyone* putting in more than they can afford to lose into ANY crypto, has had ample warning from pretty much every sub/news source, etc. and will only have themselves to blame if it goes to shit. There are so many warnings about this, and even common sense says not to do so, so you can’t help someone who is determined to do this anyway.  > Some doge holders are smart, they saw the meme potential and went eh it's worth a shot. If you bought after the pump (8 cents) I think you're an idiot even tho it somehow went even past that. If you bought at 40 cents you're actually an idiot lol. If you bought back in the day cause it actually was cheap (low marketcap) then I think that was a reasonable play assuming you didn't go all in lol. Legit no disrespect if you actually got in early, but buying at the top of a bubble? For a shitcoin with no real future other than being a meme? Just so dumb.  This could be said about any crypto that has pumped lately. Doge, XRP, Stellar, Nano, you name it. If you’re buying after a huge pump then it’s usually not a smart play. Doesn’t matter too much what the underlying coin fundamentals are unless you’re confident in the coin long term (and even then that is still a gamble as you could be completely wrong, even with the best DD).  > To recap, I think people that hold doge are dumb cause it's just a dumb play, not cause I'm sad I missed out (at this price, if you bought it earlier as a joke, no disrespect. If you fomo in, I'm sorry but you kinda deserve to lose your money).  Guess that makes me dumb. But I bought in at 0.04c and sold at close to .40c, so I guess I’ll just sit here all dumb with my 10x profit. There is a skill to reading the market. Not everything is about the coin itself, sometimes it is understanding market forces, the effects of news, the effects of fomo and other emotional drivers/sentiments. Done right you can turn a ‘dumb’ investment into a very smart play.  > these people are actually convincing themselves it's a long term investment.  Here I agree with you. I don’t think it is a good long term investment, due to some of the factual concerns you’ve highlighted. It also doesn’t have a team working on its development, which is another red flag to me. HOWEVER, I do accept that I am generally less averse to risk and so I could be very wrong and it could end up being a great long term investment. It has shown an ability to stick around for a long time, even through bear markets, has a good community and is gaining popularity all the time, so it would not surprise me if I was wrong.  > It's just unadulterated gambling and thank God for him he's probably still up, just way less.  Investing in crypto at all is a gamble, same as stocks. Plenty of people are getting shafted on even supposed “safe” investments like bitcoin. There are just different levels of risk involved. Some people make ‘smart’ bets, some people make ‘dumb’ bets, but it’s all gambling at the end of the day."

1619267996.0,2021-04-24 08:39:56,1,2,"That’s assuming a hypothetical doge price of $1 per coin (4x the current price of around .25). Which I think is achievable.   So, in this hypothetical with doge at $1, with 1 billion coins mined in a span of 70 days, then every 70 days doge needs $1 billion in increased investment just to hold value.   $1 hypothetical price x 129 billion supply = $129 billion market cap.   But if buyers and sellers are in equal volume for the next 70 days, and the total doge investment remains at $129 billion, then we can figure out what the price would be. 70 days later:  X is our hypothetical price multiplied by our new supply at 130 billion = $129 billion market cap  X x 130b = $129 billion.   Divide both sides by 130b  New price per doge: 99.2 cents.   I know it doesn’t seem like much, but if doge reaches a market cap of $129 billion, then every penny change in price is worth about 800 million in or out of the market."

Any currency, or coin, crypto, whatever only has value because people are willing to accept it as a medium for exchange. Once it is accepted as such and is being traded it now has value...because people say it does. They have a certain amount of trust in the instrument.   It doesn't matter that Doge started as a joke. Serious players are now accepting it as currency. That legitimacy makes it have value.   Strictly speaking of Doge, I have no idea where it goes. The amount being mined concerns me. But I have 5k right now and I will probably buy more. And maybe sell some and take profits. Then buy more."
1619212778.0,2021-04-23 17:19:38,1,-1,"> I don’t believe that is how price and value works.  You don't believe in math?  >People haven’t currently put in $30B into dogecoin. If that was how it worked then people putting $1 in a few years ago would just be removing $1 later, but instead there are instant millionaires who bought in a month or two ago and sold when demand pushed the price up.   That's exactly how it works. People, collectively have pumped $30B into dogecoin, and $29 billion of that has been since late Janury.  In January, the price of doge was less than a penny. Let's say .007  The market cap would be the price x supply, which would have been .007 x 128 billion coins. That's a market cap of just under $1 billion.  As people pumped more money into doge, the price went up. And as time passed, the supply increased. Now the price is .24 and the supply is 129 billion.   .24 x 129 billion coins = $30.1 billion"
1619199879.0,2021-04-23 13:44:39,1,5,"Yeah, I feel like it’s true with a lot of things but especially true with non-utility crypto; the value is based on what people will pay for it and the demand. Nothing else. IV is out the window."
1619195157.0,2021-04-23 12:25:57,1,5,That's a valid point. I don't know if it works as well comparing Bitcoin and ethereum but I certainly works well comparing a coin in the top five by market cap with one that's in the hundreds. So at a glance if you want to have a sense of how well supported the coin is in the marketplace then that can be one quick way to make that calculation. I don't think it's a very smart way to invest but it does make some sense.  However to your second point I think how much a price can change has more to do with volume of trade on a given day than anything else. On a low volume trading day a million dollars can have a greater impact on the price then on a high volume trading day for the same coin. An extreme example would be where virtually nobody was selling so the buyer was forced to buy at whatever price the seller was placing on the exchange. This could cause a dramatic increase in price which wouldn't really be reflective of a true free market.
1619201068.0,2021-04-23 14:04:28,1,1,"This is incorrect. The market cap of Bitcoin is $900 billion. There is not $900 billion dollars in Bitcoin. If every single Bitcoin was sold today you would not get $900 billion dollars unless if they were willing buyers who are willing to pick up Bitcoin at exactly the same price right now for every single Bitcoin. We know that's not true because place fluctuates based on demand. So a 1 million market cap does not need 1 million to double to 2 million. To put in another way let's say there was a coin that had a 100,000 circulating supply and was $10 a coin. That would be a 1 million market cap. If all of a sudden one day a bunch of people decided they were only going to sell their coin for $20 because Elon musk tweeted that day and then a bunch of other people decided they will buy that coin for $20 the moment it starts trading at $20 it's a market cap would double regardless if only $1,000 was exchanged that day."
1619203127.0,2021-04-23 14:38:47,1,1,"That’s not how market cap works. Depending on the price and the supply, you could increase the market cap by a trillion dollars with a single dollar. That’s why it’s a useless metric."

1619214523.0,2021-04-23 17:48:43,0,3,"Bro - we agree with each other. But Dogecoin is not deflationary. ITS RATE OF INFLATION in decreasing.  Huge, huge difference.   Read the comments section of that post. I talk to u/ CEO_OF_DOGECOIN regularly. I’ve already read the post - I talk to him all the time. We know each other   “I encourage others also to make their own FAQ, and I know that there are others e.g. u/Adventurous_Piglet85 who have already made FAQs, and there others still who have been copy-pasting stuff from my old FAQ (and I remain totally happy for anyone to do that).  In the long run it may make sense to merge FAQs and have a single one as a community, but for now I think it makes sense for things to be separate.  If anyone can think of an error in my FAQ please let me know.”  This is my explanation that I wrote. It goes into more detail.  His FAQ is a condensed version of what I wrote .   Approximately 600,000 dogecoins are produced per hour and 5,256,000,000 (5.26 billion) per year and there are currently approximately 128,000,000,000 (128 billion) Dogecoin. Now let’s compare this information to what we know about Bitcoin. Bitcoin currently has a supply of 18.5 million. Currently 900 Bitcoin are mined per day or 328,500 per year. However, unlike Dogecoin, Bitcoins mining rate is not fixed. Bitcoin has something known as a Bitcoin halving which means at some point in the future instead of 900 per day being mined 450 are mined. Now let’s compare Dogecoin and Bitcoin to the US Dollar. The US Dollar has an estimated paper money supply (more on this covered in a later section) of approximately (1.2 to 2 trillion) and in 2019 the federal reserve printed 188.3 billion paper dollars. This means that there is 10 times more supply of dollars to Dogecoin and the government prints 37 times more dollars than Dogecoin is mined per year. It is also important to note that this increase in supply of Dogecoin is fixed. It never changes. The federal reserve can change how much they print any given year. Many people think that this means that the supply of Dogecoin is infinite or infinitely increasing. That is not true in the span of our life time. It will take approximately 24 years for the supply of Dogecoin to double and it will take 360 years for the supply of Dogecoin to reach the current supply of the US Dollar. That’s without taking into account the fact that federal reserve adds more dollars each year than Dogecoin adds to its supply each year. Technically speaking the supply of Dogecoin will eventually reach infinity if given enough time but you have to remember that infinity isn’t an actual number. You can’t mine “infinite” dogecoin because infinity isn’t a number. It’s a mathematical concept to describe something that is boundless. Dogecoin doesn’t have a boundless increase. It has a fixed increase a set amount added at a specific interval. So in practical terms for the purpose of using Dogecoin as a legitimate currency, this infinite argument against Dogecoin doesn’t matter. In fact it’s actually way better than Bitcoin at exchanging goods and services because of this fact. That is why the price per Bitcoin is in the ten thousand range the price per Dogecoin is in the cents range That is why it costs .00012 Bitcoin for milk but only 50 Dogecoin for that same commonly traded commodity. That’s why Bitcoin will be treated like digital gold. That is why Dogecoin will be considered the next dollar. The price per coin are inherently different because their supplies are different."

GME I get it, the thought behind that was to stick it to the man. it made sense. People admitted they just wanted to stick it to the man and didn't care if they made money, many people became millionaires.... Insane, but great for them.  Then dogecoin, legit, this isn't a stick it to the man thing, it's a ""omg Elon Musk loves doge, LETS GO!"" Like the guy im talking about who made the million literally said that Elon backs the coin, that's his take from Elon's twitter posts. It's insane to me anyone would come to any conclusion other than ""Elon is memeing this shit as a joke, it holds little to no real value.""  Why people would invest $180k in it, is absolutely irresponsible. That person, if he doesn't actually panic and sell, will likely have less money by the time this memeing is over.  I've got a diversified portfolio with my investments, but I'm sitting over here like. I have to be the dumb one not to be investing in the meme right? People are actually buying this shit as a solid investment they believe will not only retain but increase in value?   I must be going crazy with the state the world is in. I just want to know what's the next meme coin so I can hop on board now with my life savings!"

It's like looking at how fast a human grows during their pre-teen years and saying that's what you should judge their growth throughout their lifespan on. It's ignoring the driving factor behind that growth...puberty.  In this case, the PND scheme is artificially inflating doge's value. Doge _may_ have sustained value after the scheme is over, but anyone trying to say this PND scheme is representative of doge's future growth is in denial. You included.  Every PND scheme grows ""a thousand times higher than the inflation rate"" until it doesn't, and at that point it's a matter of who the bagholders are.  The fact that you guys can look at a market where every single thing is down, see your grift coin up, and not realize something doesn't add up is amazing to me.  Gamble if you can afford it.

The more shit coins and pump and dump schemes we have, the more damage is done to the long-term acceptance of crypto. In addition, it takes attention and money away from coins that actually have relevant applications. Crypto will never succeed if coins like Doge are at the top and many people understand this.

Wouldn't have said that b4 this rally and Elon musk putting in 1.5b. Ya I guess you can say it's all gamblng,but that's the difference between gambling and actually investing. Buying btc most 10 coin is a genuine risky investment. Buying doge isn't risky, it's a raw gamble lol. People don't realize that, they actually think they're being responsible by investing.   I think you're smart for selling at 40 cents, it's people that hodl doge that I just don't get. I personally wouldn't have bought at 4 cents, but I don't think it's straight moronic. What's dumb is putting your life investments in and not selling at 40 cents lol.   I don't think you're stupid cause you're honest with yourself. You're flipping it for money, not hodling a shitcoin aha.   I made fat money off safemoon but I'm aware it's a meme. That's pretty much it, a lot of doge holders are straight uninformed and holding a garbage coin with hopes of making millions. I'd rest easier having bought nano at the top than doge, but ya buying at the height of a bubble isn't great. It's justifiable if you're in it long term, which I think is absurd to be in doge for long term.   I care about people losing their money cause it gives the scene a horrible rep. People are gonna get burnt and have trauma so they're not gonna invest in crypto in general.   Imho it's a more complicated ponzi, so is safemoon, so are all shitcoins. The money being made is from someone losing. Btc ain't a Ponzi cause it's actually useful... Doge tho? Safemoon? ASS? it's crazy how many, not straight up scams, but genuine Ponzi's there are in the space.   I care because I'm afraid of the government stepping in and ""protecting"" us from these ""scams"" I believe in everyone's right to be an idiot and buy dumb shit at the top, I don't want anyone stepping in.   Charles from Ada talks about this a lot recently and I agree. It's super dangerous for regulations that may come, it makes crypto look beyond dumb (already looks dumb to most people, people tend to not have high opinion of even btc)  In short, it's a Ponzi, gullible people are losing their money (which is their right, I just think it's sad), and it may lead to unneeded regulation.   It's also a POW coin and just a waste of energy, like at least btc is a store of value. Doge is, by design with the whole inflation thing, supposed to be spent and not hodld. It being POW is so fucking bad LOL, it's garbage long term unless the non team they have switches to POS.   People are entitled to gamble on shitcoins, I just find it entertaining when people don't admit it's a meme and really think Amazon is gonna accept doge of all crypto... Fucking doge bro. It's also low key a mockery of a whole industry but whatever, I don't mean to be pretentious."

When investing, I'd argue it is more important how much your money can grow.   When it put $1,000 into your investing account, does it really matter how many coins you buy? All that matter is your % return. Additionally, does it really matter the specific price increase of the investment? If I told you an investment went up in price $5 that means nothing without context. If I meant $5 increase in ETH price you wouldn't even see a difference when your balance reads roughly $1,001.75. But if I meant DOGE your balance would read an unrealistic $20,000.   These examples illustrate that quantity doesn't really mean much without context. Your point about inflation is a real point to make, I'd only caution that if you aren't concerned about ETH inflation, the numbers show you should be even less concerned with DOGE inflation."

As soon as the new coin is tradeable...it generally rockets up to 10 dollars...no matter where it starts from.

It's legitimate to wonder if Doge has peaked, but it doesn't look like ETH will.     BTC? Well, that's the name brand store of value, but use case? Being finite helps the logic. Otherwise....shrug.

1619241033.0,2021-04-24 01:10:33,0,0,"What you are referring to, I think, it's the money multiplier. Think about it this way. When you work, you earn x dollars. then u use them to buy good and services. those same dollars are then used by those people who now own them to buy goods and services, invest , put in a bank account, whatever. When you buy a truck, the dealer sells it to you for x amount of money, the bank is selling you the right to use money for x amount of interest. this is the banks opportunity cost of using that money for something else. If I explained that I  a stupid way, let's try this: the bank lending money is the same as a parking lot leasing the parked vehicles. The lot didnt create new vehicles, it simply let you park them there, then turned around and lend them to someone else for a premium (interest rate). Now, assuming they were allowed to so this, it wouldn't be good business for the parking lot to do this because they would have to pay for the wear and tear of the car and that car would be worth less for the owner when they get it back, because it is also a depreciating asset. The main reason banks can do this is because money has jo intrinsic value, it has no worth in and of itself, it is only worth what the government says it is worth (fiat currency). In theory, the reason for this mechanism to exist is so money can keep circulating into the economy and continue to be used as a means of exchange. If every dollar were to be used only once, then what's the point? In theory, there is no duplication since there are always two sides of a transaction: I deposit the money, bank takes it, that's an asset for me, a liability for them. the bank lends it, that's an asset for them, a liability for the borrower. This is how we know it is the same dollar. athe interest paid by the borrower is not new money either, it is simply money taken from the economy by the borrower and transferred to the bank. As you can see there are many links on these chain where trouble can begin, starting with proper accounting. Banks assume ppl are not going to demand their deposits back all at once, and the government agrees. This is largelyy true, but if you want to see what happens when this assumption breaks down, look up ""corralito Argentina""for a real example of a bank run."
1619215280.0,2021-04-23 18:01:20,1,4,No they are not creating money. They are lending the money given to them by their depositors. It’s someone’s actual money... where do you think the cash come from?   They are actually using money that people have deposited in their “savings account”. What did you think a savings account was for? they aren’t just setting up a new account you can draw new money from... that is not how it works

The thing is, my financial planning is based on index funds I have the discipline to hold (I was the only one in my family to hold through 2020 lol), assuming 7% return after inflation. Crypto is me gambling with leftover money hoping to catch a few 1000%+ returns I'll never see in my index funds.

I should note however that everything Ray noted is also applicable to crytpo too, in some cases moreso, especially Doge which which has massive inflation principally baked into it (1 billion coins a year), you know ATOM, ETH, XRP etc all have large inflation too, it's intentionally a part of their model?   Moreso, as Ray noted currency does depreciate, be it fiat or crytpo but fiat has been depreciating for centuries, long before crypto came along and will continue to do so long after so why would we assume the crunch, the end would come now in out lifetime's? How does this impact us?   Fiats gonna keep on Fiating for long after we're gone don't worry about that.   I'm not saying we hold our money as £€¥$ in the bank and get by on interest, I'm saying (as noted in a previous post) crypto is a better investment of wealth but when we're done investing we will all, as we do now, divest it for fiat and spend it.

It's an entire platform to let developers easily make programs (websites, apps, anything) on the blockchain.   It's not just digital payments anymore, it's an entire infrastructure to our Internet and platform to build decentralized apps so we don't have mega corporations owning all of our stuff.

I'd always take payment for services rendered in crypto or gold over fiat any day.

Again you are acting like interest is some magical thing it isn’t. Just because you have “interest” doesn’t mean you are creating money. Idk why you think that. Interest is just the cost of money. It’s like any other object. If I rented you a machine to pick Apples on your orchard you pay me right? Instead of money you can choose to accept a percentage of the apples I harvest, and I will give you the machine back. That’s the same idea as lending and borrowing money. The machine is the loan and the apples you receive as payment is the interest. The machine allowed me to create value so I was able to pay interest. It’s as simple as that. Same thing with money. You giving me money now allows me to make more money, so I pay you interest for “renting” your money."

I'm going to get killed in options when I finally pull that trigger.     I admit I know very little about ADA. My very limited knowledge is that it operates in the same space as ETH. Some people call it an ethereum killer. Others are adamant it never can be. I have no idea tbh but I believe in that concept so I believe in both. I know far more about ETH (very limited knowledge still) than I do ADA.     My only recommendation is to do as much research as you can with a critical eye. Question your sources. Is the broker article you read a sales pitch to hype you on crypto and get you to open an account? Is a reddit user really any smarter or more informed than you are? Is a Yahoo finance article just churning out click bait? Having this kind of critical thinking will help you weight the relevance of information as you learn more

Central Banks, yes, absolutely. Think of anytime in human history when there hasn't been some form of centralisation, a body or authority that doesn't control money to some degree, why would we assume it stops here and now with us, this generation when all signs point conclusively to no? Right now we're living in the most centralised economy in human existence and it's pushing further and faster into more centralisation. If anything crytpo will be centralised because bottom line if the government can't put their hand in your pocket and take their share they will shut it down. They are either invited to the party or they crash it. It's not nice but it's true.   Crypto has tremendous momentum now, institutional and retail investment, it doesn't look now like it's going away. Further, it's a great investment in the sense that money invested in crypto beats money traditionaly invested in fiat but it won't replace fiat, not in our lifetime or certainly not within a timeframe we should be planning and investing for.   I don't know it's too complicated, you can spend years at uni learning then then go on to work in finance and it's still not enough to touch the sides. All in saying is, fiat has been failing slowly for centuries and it will continue to fail slowly for centuries more, don't invest your money on a whim that a global financial schism is looming, invest it on what you know and what you can see, not the egalitarian ideal you'd like to happen.

(1) Market cap is not a measurement or gauge of future potential and (2)The growing supply point was completely misleading without speaking to the fact it’s deflationary and represents a decreasing % of supply over time, eventually leading to a negligible yearly addition in proportion to the existing supply.  In my experience over the past 8 years it’s been the best and most insane long term return I’ve had in my portfolio. It’s worth as much as people deem it to be worth, like many intangible things. As for scalability and sustainability - If Doge could make it this far in the past 8 years, it can make it another 8 especially with added visibility and awareness.

1619214741.0,2021-04-23 17:52:21,2,3,"No. Dogecoin is a real project and was forked from Litecoin. It's a literal copy of their codebase with some tweaked parameters. However, development has pretty much died down since then, which poses a few problems:  &#x200B;  1. If there is a bug or a problem there is nobody to fix it. Maybe someone will volunteer to do it, but people would just have to hope that that's the case. 2. There is no clear use case for Dogecoin, due to it's design.    1. It's not a store of value        1. It is much too centralized. There are multiple huge wallets that nobody knows who they belong to. Other cryptos have this problem as well, but not to the same degree.       2. It has too much inflation. The amount of money that would have to flow into doge to sustain the price is insane. Why would you use doge as a store of value if you knew that the amount relative to the total amount that exists is going down over time? A store of value needs to be something that is scarce or hard to obtain, like gold, Art or BTC.     2. It's not a currency.       1. Dogecoin's inflationary model was chosen precisely to incentivize people to spend it and discourage hoarding, pretty much like fiat money. But the amount of transactions that dogecoin can process (about 33 transactions per second) isn't anywhere near what's required to use it as a currency. To actually use doge as a global currency you would need something like 100'000 transactions per second. There are multiple other projects trying to implement solutions to this problem (ETH 2.0, BTC Lightning, etc).    3. It's not a DAPP plattform.       1. There are no smart contracts. So no DEFI, no DEX, no NFTs, etc.  So what exactly is Dogecoin supposed to be? Of course, it's still as capable as Litecoin was a few years ago, maybe even as capable as Litecoin now, I actually haven't followed Litecoin all that much because I think it's equally as dead. But the fact remains, nobody is seriously working on it to solve any of the above problems. And even if they were to start now, they would have to catch up a huge amount of work. And I haven't seen any indication whatsoever that this is happening.  So the only reason that I see that remains why one should buy dogecoin is for the lulz and because everybody else does."
1619215298.0,2021-04-23 18:01:38,1,2,"Impossible is a hard bar to clear. You could argue that nothing is impossible. Unlikely shit happens all the time, that's not the point. Most people that have invested in BTC, ETH or other projects because they value the technology have always been bullish on it. The big question mark is just the time frame. Nobody knows when mass adoption comes, or when a solution which is scalable is ready for production use and others start to see it's potential and trust it.   Btw, I wouldn't call being over 0.2 for a few days stable. Let's see what happens. I'm happy for everybody who makes some money during this. I am talking to the people who don't know about any of this stuff and are considering putting a lot of their money at stake because everybody seems to be making money.  And if you want to know why $10 is highly unlikely, you just need to read through the actual post we are commenting here. If you don't understand the underlying technology, how blockchain works and how DOGE is different from ETH, BTC and others on a technical level, then I would advice you to be careful.  The reason why I actually hope that DOGE doesn't make it to $10 isn't because I wish ill on those who have invested in it. It's because I am absolutely convinced that in the long term DOGE will not be able to hold that value, and the crash and onslaught that will ensue will be that much worse the higher it goes in the first place."

1619309029.0,2021-04-24 20:03:49,1,1,"Appreciate the reply and think that’s a reasonable and rational outlook on crypto/Bitcoin and probably the one I’m closest to atm.  However, sudden currency crashes that render a once good/strong currency useless are not the stuff of doomsayers or utopians—quite the opposite, they’re a recurring global pattern throughout history. Will the USD and current fiat system suffer from the same? According to economic history it’s quite possible and maybe even likely, as these crashes are tied to authorities trying to manage their way out of crises brought on by debt cycles (and the current situation is of looking strong—looks fairly clear we’re at the end of debt cycle rather than middle or beginning). Also important here is the fact that monetary systems also change—they are not constant and the last big one was obviously Bretton Woods in 1944.  It’s against this background that I’ve assumed a decentralized currency built on blockchain technology starts to make sense. The technology now allows decentralization, whereas before it was not possible. It’s now theoretically possible (putting all the limitations and issues aside) to have a new, technically superior, decentralized, global monetary standard based on the blockchain; one that’s potentially not controlled by the same crowd responsible for the all the crashes.  I’ve assumed some/a lot of the movement, to Bitcoin in particular, is a hedge against that scenario. The closer we get to some kind of financial implosion of the current system, the more people see BTC as a safe haven for their money. Slowly as people realize that their money might be on shaky ground, they start to move it into Bitcoin and if you see the stats on who owns what percentages of global wealth, most of it is concentrated in a few hands, so would only take them to move.   I have no idea how accurate this theory is. It’s my take on it and I’m no expert on crypto or financial systems, but this how I’m currently thinking about things. So I can see how a crypto could be a store of value (as a hedge for future calamity like gold) and a future common currency, but what I really struggle with is the investment side of things. This is where I hit the Buffet/Munger wall; how is crypto a good investment when it doesn’t produce anything? If we’re talking investment via value creation, as opposed to speculation, wouldn’t you rather put your hard earned money into the ingenuity of people and their ability to create something out of nothing, than into a store of value or a currency? As I understand it, Buffet/Munger don’t invest in gold for the same reason either, which makes the argument that they don’t get it weaker.  The current question I have around this is: what would it take for Buffet/Munger to change their minds on crypto? They don’t like it as it doesn’t produce anything, but when might they have to use it? What if an asset they wanted to buy demanded payment in Bitcoin only? They could take their current assets and convert it to Bitcoin at the going rate and that would solve that. But, of course they might be kicking themselves that they didn’t get Bitcoin earlier when it much cheaper, but would that really bother them as long as the trade at the time makes sense?  I seem to be trapped between a rock and a hard place. I don’t think crypto looks like a great investment compared to other options (equites that produce value over time if they’re any good and dividends along the way), but can also see the case for people seeking a safe haven because the current financial system is looking precarious as we head toward the end of this debt cycle (and yes, obviously end of debt cycles can cause a lot of problems—just need to look at the Great Depression).  It seems to me that crypto is mostly speculation and fomo atm—but could be wrong on that. I am an investor, but I’m not a gambler. Can’t decide if crypto is for me or not. As soon as I think I have some kind of grip on it, the rope tends to slip."

Just because they are not paid doesn't mean they are not any different from any other coin. And the cool thing this community would fund a dev team if it grow to the point if it needs it.

Buy a candy bar with bitcoin and the fees negates the cost how will that ever be a currency. This will have a floor between 1-10$ no highs no lows just doge.

1619312780.0,2021-04-24 21:06:20,0,1,"Currencies do fail fairly regularly but I'm not sure one the size of the USD has ever failed, I'm not even sure of the consequence of such an event; the world's reserve currency, the petrodollar. If it failed the US wouldn't be able to service their debt nor then would any other country as financial contagion kicks in, the markets would fail, all of them. Could you imagine society were this to happen? Would you go to work as a firefighter or police officer (any job) knowing you weren't getting paid?  The failure of a currency doesn't necessitate obsolescence it could just be an event that forces change. I see the same debt ratios everyone else sees and I do worry about it, I can't even imagine how they could be paid off under the current monetary system so it's not unreasonable now to expect another Bretton Woods moment.  https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/a-new-world-monetary-order-is-coming-202010271624  Appropriate given the context?  Maybe consider that a potential failure doesn't necessarily mean implosion and death but more a new direction, a change? Personally I'm not in crypto to hedge against the death of fiat bit moreso that it performs better than fiat stagnating.  I'm interested to know your thoughts on decentralisation, you seem to like the idea but have you considered the drawbacks? Without centralisation it can't be properly regulated, you noted that you didn't want the same old institutions controlling and crashing money but if decentralised finance became a thing those old institutions would just buy into it with their huge purchasing power and own it completely, control it completely. Decentralisation is a monopolistic capitalists wet dream with nothing or nobody to hold them back. Apple have enough money in reserve right now to buy every single bitcoin minted if they wanted and they are just one blue chip on one exchange in one country.   We've already seen the negative side of decentralisation, consider perhaps bitcoin ownership, currently about 95% of bitcoin is held by 2% of accounts. Structurally bitcoin is decentralised but actually it is not. You don't want the old guard crashing the market but all you'll possibly get is the new guard manipulating the market.   What's to stop F2pool going short on a margin trade then dumping 5000 BTC then stopping and go long buying up 5500 BTC? Without some degree of centralisation or regulation this will continue.   I wouldn't worry about Buffett and Munger, first of all they are products of their generation, they were the top of their generation and they fit perfectly (amazingly) into it, times change though, the next Warren Buffet will have a different mind set which is better suited to tomorrow's challenges. You can't blame him though, Warren Buffett, he made his billions using Extreme Value analysis, a theorywhich is  incongruent to Bitcoin; how can you deep dive and find exteeem value in coin/token the same way you could going through a companies financials with a fine tooth comb? They were perfect products of their environment but the landscape is changing.   I'm fully with you there, with regards to not being able to make your mid up about crytpo, I have the exact same sentiments you noted and I don't have an answer you myself, I have to stop myself every now and again and seriously ask myself if I am FOMOing and just deluding myself. I truly don't know. I was going to put a bit more in last month, I had the money ready and I'm not sure why but something clicked and I stopped and thought ""bitcoin was 4k last year, it's 50k now, WHO BUYS AT THE TOP OF THE MARKET, STOP"". I seriously don't know what to do, I've made a lot in the last few years from a pretty small principal sum but its now at an amount I'm not willing to lose, it's scary. So do I take it out? No because I'm also scared it will pop off without me. I don't know.   Also, just curious, have you studied economics or work in finance?   Reading your response I'm pretty confident that you should trust your own judgement with regards how you invest, I think youl do quite well, you have a good grounding."

But it doesn't take a genius to see that they are years behind now and the various problems that they face, even before they get to the point where most other crypto currencies are now. Check out this thread for instance: [https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1849](https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/1849)  A random assortment of people discussing if dogecoin should follow bitcoin, bitcoin bash, or maybe wrap dogecoin in ethereum?

1619226778.0,2021-04-23 21:12:58,1,1,"I did read it, and it starts from the wrong assumption that Doge would grow to 10$ on its own.  I don't see Doge reaching 10$ in this bull run cycle, but even if it did, it would because the rest of the crypto market would have grown to allow it. For Doge to grow 30x we would need BTC to grow 10x and ETH 15x, for example. And if that happened, the capitalization of companies like Tesla or Facebook would go up as well because of the amount of crypto they hold. It's not like people expect Doge to suddenly become the world's most valued asset.   OP's post shows a false dichotomy by asking ""Can Doge reach 10$ just lile that?"", which obviously can't happen. Instead, if the question was ""Can the market grow in a shape that allows Doge to reach 10$?"", then the answer is yes, or at least maybe.  Then it goes on with the inflation, which we have talked about already."

Lets say the price of doge is .25  Thats 3,500$ that would have to be invested PER MINUTE to hold this price level. **At this rate thats $1,839,600,000 would have to be spent to hold this price level PER YEAR.** MORE if you expect this price to increase. And, cool. Sometimes the price will rise for a bit before one of the whales who own 50% of your shitcoin decide its their turn to dump this garbage. Like what literally just happened. One of the whales dumped their stock of this garbage and all the little guys pay the price for being stuck with it.  You really cant figure out why something that is supposed to hold value is a RED FLAG when 14,000 new ones are made every minute? Good lordy.  Literally why do you think Bitcoin is such a good investment? SUPPLY AND DEMAND. The SUPPLY is capped at 21 million and this target will likely be hit in \~140 years. So if people want to invest in it they get a small % of the big pie, then see their investment actually do work for them because they hold a piece of the pie. Your dogshit (pun intended) investment currently has  **129,307,300,055** in circulation with  7,358,400,000  more added PER YEAR. NICE! Nice 'supply' there. Good luck having the demand EVER be on par with that level of printing.  DOGE is what non tech saavy people who flunked out of algebra 1 invest in.

1619244500.0,2021-04-24 02:08:20,1,1,"Buddy, we're running in circles here, you're talking about inflation again.  Yes, you are right. At 0.25, it takes about 2B a year to keep the same price level. But what happens if those extra 2B are not being poured? Well, with the current market cap at about 40B the price would dramatically drop to 0.24$!  As much as going down from 0.25 to 0.24 once a year is a terrible loss and a giant red flag for you, we're talking about a highly speculative market where any new development milestone will easily drive the price up from 0.25 to 0.50$ or more. As much as those numbers look very big, the impact of the supply increase is the same as a spit on the ocean. That's why I say that increase in value outwheighs by far the supply increase.  And yes, BTC has a limited supply which is an advantage as a store of value. But you can ask any economist out there, the numbers look big but anyone who has an idea on how currencies work will tell you that a 4% annual supply increase is perfectly fine. And that percentage, by the way, will go down every year as volume goes up.  About whales. Yes, they are there, they hold too much compared to the circulating money and that is a concern. That's a point for you if you will. But then again, all coins have their whales and I'm not sure how bad is Doge compared to other coins in this particular thing.   You keep saying that I don't listen or want to be educated, but maybe what happens is that I am already educated and can see through the bullshit. Many other coins have a yearly supply increase similar to Doge, but it's only a big red flag when it comes to Doge. Maybe you should take a look at the mirror, you claim to be educated but are falling on confirmation bias here, when you are supposed to analyze the market objectively."

When the whole thing blew up I decided to sink what I could truly afford to lose into it, just so if it went parabolic, I’d have *something* to show for it, and wouldn’t be as bitter as some on this sub are about doge success.   I decided that was a hundred bucks. Dropped it into Kucoin margin trade at 5x and made a quick $300. So now I have $400 worth of Doge from money I was OK with losing entirely. Spent it all on Doge during the dip, not at the very bottom,  but on the way back up (regular trade this time, not margin). So I’ve basically 10x’d so far. I was gonna sell at .30, but with this news, will hang on a while and see what happens."

So a new user risks not even learning the basics about market cap or circulating supply. Or more importantly, how to do due dilligence on projects.

I've held some DOGE since 2017, and I absolutely adore the community back then. Recently in late 2020, seems like the tone shifted to more of a greed oriented posts. Promising DOGE would reach USD 1, 10, even 100. That's when the 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE vibes died. But community grows, and it is what it is.   I trust that DOGE would still be a good starter for anyone going into crypto just for the fun of it. The danger comes when DOGE holders disregard the technology behind it, or how it would be in the long run without shillers such as the world's richest man, Elon Musk.   DOGE is dependent on shillers. When Elon tweets, it goes up. When he didn't tweet, it might even crash a bit. It's has been recently a *high risk, high reward* coin. I saw it as a *low risk, low reward coin.* The dynamics of it all changed so much.  However, I wouldn't put my money where it is dependent to a man to shill it. That makes it somewhat... centralized.   Is buying DOGE OK? Of course it is. But it's not OK to believe it would be technologically better in the long run against the likes of BTC, and ETH IMO."

There’s paths, a playground, a water pad, basketball courts, concession stands, multiple sports fields, bathrooms etc etc   We’re all saying “come to the park, it’s really nice”.    But all the new DOGE only people are like “nah, I’m gonna play in the expressway”  We’re like “ok...but that’s pretty dangerous and dumb, especially considering there’s an awesome park here”  But then doge newcomers say “nah, were gonna gang up and stop all the traffic and play here”  Sure, you *could* do that. I’ve seen pedestrians shut down expressways.  It’s dangerous, but possible.   But it eventually always opens back up as an expressway, it doesn’t become a park.    Food for thought"

He's posting this not to brag, but to inspire the rest of that community not to sell.  If you ever need a little pick me up, go visit the dog subreddit. It is by far not people bragging about their gains.  Do Only Good Everyday. The doge community really does actually give back to their community.   I've been in contact with one person in particular that is planning to feed all the people experiencing homelessness at a certain intersection in Austin Texas. Not only did he initiate this, but he has rallied me and dozens of other people around him.  And just clarify, if you're not familiar with Austin, there is a really prominent political debate right now about homelessness in Austin. We have a proposition on our ballet right now to decide whether or not we should give homeless people tickets just for being on the sidewalk.  I guess I don't really want to go off on a tangent, but the point is that I don't really see any other community rallied around any other coin that has the same mentality.  What you see as bragging about ""oooh my millions"", a lot of people saw that as ""We're all here together.""  Let's commit to doing good in our own communities.   I haven't seen that in btc, I have not seen that ethereum. Literally the only community that I see on Reddit that is committed to giving back to the community is Doge.

I mean, if you had a few billion doge and you had the opportunity to sell it at 40 cents and dropping until it collapsed, you’d be crazy not to, because it might not get past a cent or two for years once the mania is done.  But the thing these people don’t realize is, once enough of their brethren lose faith or need at least some of their money back, the exits are going to pack to the gills.  It’s depressing, I’m sure there are some very good people in there who just don’t understand how much power a massive whale can hold, and it has nothing to do with “destroying the coin” and everything to do with “becoming rich in actual currency.”  You could make the same argument for BTC, but BTC has institutional investment and ATMs and real world use and is expensive to produce.  Doge is... just doge."

1619268968.0,2021-04-24 08:56:08,0,3,"People do not like that a majority of the DOGE is in the wallets of a few people.   Think about it like this. Say we're all on a hot air balloon, and every person in the basket controls a percentage of the air in the balloon. They can release or hold on.   Now, what if I told you that a handful of people controlled 90% of the air? How safe would you feel? Even if you thought they wanted to continue to rise as well, wouldn't you feel uneasy knowing they had so much control over whether the balloon goes up or down?   If those people let go of their stash, everything (the price) comes tumbling down."
1619270980.0,2021-04-24 09:29:40,1,3,Best explanation I can give is watch the chart of 4/20. Whales control the price completely. They never let it go past .420 and through out the day the price continued to fall. That was whales dumping coins and taking all the small investors profit. It was really disturbing to watch. People thinking they're going to make a quick 100 while this whale is pulling millions out of their pockets
1619282091.0,2021-04-24 12:34:51,0,3,It would need new investments worth millions a day to sustain the current price and majority of people do not believe it's possible.

1619267656.0,2021-04-24 08:34:16,0,2,I said it before and  I will say it again. Doge is a joke coin pumped by Elon and bought but his twitter mob. A lot of people will get seriously burned purely because of billionaire joke.  It is not 'safe to assume' that it will stabilise. It has been pumped mostly by people who do not understand much about Doge and price is constantly pushed down by increasing supply. Stories about people who bought 'this dog money because space guy backed by his mars company' said so are terrifying.

That can pump for so long but eventually either he'll move on or people will tire of his tweets and the novelty will wear off. It just doesn't have much upside"

Thats more of a price prediction, snd a lofty one at that.   Welcome to r/cryptocurrency. My advice is to diversify your future crypto portfolio with some more “solid” investments."
1619267995.0,2021-04-24 08:39:55,3,1,Imagine investing in doge long term
1619269786.0,2021-04-24 09:09:46,0,1,"First i am sorry i have terrible grammer and I'm on a phone. I have dyslexia so I really had a hard time in school. Hopefully this makes sense.   Let me explain what's going on.  Crypto currency was never ment to be about getting rich.  It was about libertation and it was used to  circumvent governments and banks.   It worked when the people that used it understood what they were doing.  Fast forward to 2016 suddenly it started to make people rich and everyone started slowly buying into the hype.  The question is how it started to go up in value so much?  The answer is the rich pumped it.  This literally is the biggest and longest pump and  dump scam in history.  Billionaires and millionairs bought up cheap Crypto starting somewhere around 2016 and that's when the public started buying.  Things were great people put made money hand over first everyone was a genius.  Now because crypto only goes up people started to use what's called leverage.  In simple terms I put up $100 and I can get $1000 worth of crypto to bet on higher gains or I could sort crypto by no one shorts everyone thinks to the moon. No credit check no anything just free money! Here is the thing the exchanges they are not going to let people walk with gains they paid for. They know that the whales will start to sell when they see that everyone is leveraged.   Here's the thing if you bet on the price going up and it goes down you get liqudated and it happens in a flash.  Guess what when you get liqudated the market goes further down and the next guy gets liqudated and on it goes. So it goes that Bitcoin went from $21,000 to $4,000 overnight. All that money went to the rich people that started that pump.  Now all they have to do is wait until people forget.  Fast forward 4 to 5 years and they use that money they made to buy more cheap crypto causing a bigger pump then the last one.  Of course we have new blood to steal from now and so it goes.   Now how did this relate to Doge? Well The same wealthy people that are pumping the market jp Morgan saying bitcoin will hit $149,000 behind the scenes they are pumping and dumping bitcoin last week 9 billion dollar's was liqudated in a couple hours. Then they take that money and pump doge watch the markets bitcoin falls doge goes up. Today i watched doge go from .20 to .26 over and over.  Every time it guess up its the whales seeding the market . Then they pump people to come by and they sell. So your money isn't moving the coin up is buying the whale out.   The current Crypto Currency mania is exactly the same as 2018 when the market crashed. It's sad to watch the poor get fleeced by the rich again. Crypto was born to free the people but has been stolen by the rich to funnel money from the poor taking money from the desperate and the greedy. This will be the most accurate thing replied and the proof is playing out. I wish I could explain to people what's going on but the mania is to high. :("
1619267204.0,2021-04-24 08:26:44,0,0,DOGE is open to infinite inflation. It is not a good investment long term.

When/if they sell the price, will drop considerably to a fraction of a cent.   Also, Doge has a high year to year inflation so to keep the price up needs continuous pump."
1619267385.0,2021-04-24 08:29:45,0,1,"I have a little money in it for fun but I don't see how people are putting serious money in a joke. BTC and ETH make much better long term investments, dogecoin is like a slot machine. I might win some money but I understand the house might win on this one."
1619267738.0,2021-04-24 08:35:38,1,1,"It means that once the hype will lower in magnitude, the price will go down by a lot. It's not a 100% and you can't predict when it will do this, but the chances of the price stabilizing at a high price like the current one are really low.  This is because over the course of a year around 5 billions new doge are introduced into the market. And the way crypto and all other currencies work is that each new coin introduced into the market will slightly lower the value of all existing coins.  To offset this, there has to be a constant demand for doge and that demand has to be higher then the quantity of new coins introduced. This can't be true forever, so when the demand will dwindle (and it will due to the lack of any intrinsic value) the price will ""crash""."

The prices for rare ones soared and there were literally people who were investing their children's college money in them.  Then people said, 'I'm done with this' and the market fell.    The same with baseball cards, and 1990's comic books.  These are all examples of hyped 'investments' that went up in value tremendously before they crashed, never to return in price.  (I watched a documentary on Netflix a few months ago about a guy who was a big-time card collector in high school in the 1990's/2000s.  He stored his collection when he went to college, and about 10 years later he dug it out and was going to sell them for some serious bucks... until he discovered that they were all worthless.)  My opinion is that Doge is the same thing.  The whales will keep pumping it until they can sell their stashes.  Then the price will fall and everyone else will be left holding the bag."

1619267904.0,2021-04-24 08:38:24,2,2,Pretty much this: DOGE is a hypecoin and it’s value is related mostly to the fact that it’s trending and people fomo over it. Once this bull market ends or starts to suffer then those who got into DOGE will probably just go back to whatever they were doing

1619270500.0,2021-04-24 09:21:40,1,1,"My reasoning behind the last sentence is that hype is actually something that has a prize in our world so if I'm seeing Doge's subredddit being the one increasing the most and a lot of people talking about it, it is not that hard to imagine we are not in the highest point of the hype.   With how you all talking it seems that Doge has to die in 2 months at max, and it just feels different to me than what I'm seeing.   What differentiates you from the people saying it's impossible for doge to reach 0.1? An the other thing that interest me is: so the idea is that when things will go bad for doge it will just regress to <0.01? If it is growing that well isn't it fair to asume that a 40% of the increase is here to stay long term?"

1619271274.0,2021-04-24 09:34:34,1,1,Could you elaborate? Is long term 5+ years for you? Do you think the hype will die in a 1-2 months perios of time?
1619268885.0,2021-04-24 08:54:45,1,3,It's not as simple as that. Doge has no real value except the hype. It will end some day and some people will be left holding the bag with no value. I am happy for people who have made money from it or who will but please don't market it as a long term investment opportunity. There will be no real use case for Doge.

1619273857.0,2021-04-24 10:17:37,0,1,"60% of its ATH wouldn't be $1.20 which is what you asked.  If you are actually serious then no, nobody saying it will crash is saying it will crash upwards to $1.20.  Nobody as in not a single person ever in the history of crypto has used ""crash"" to mean the price will triple.  As least not outside of joking."
1619270860.0,2021-04-24 09:27:40,1,2,"It would if you didn’t take into account that DOGE is inflationary by nature. These block rewards are fixed, meaning that no more or no less than 10,000 dogecoins will be awarded to miners every minute.  Every minute.    So when the fervor, hype, and #doge die down, 10,000 Dogecoins will still continuously be minted and march out into the world.  BTW, I’m not saying it’s *impossible* for it to hit a dollar.  It’s possible, but to say that it will hit it and hold it for anything longer than a few weeks is highly unlikely.  Especially when the bear market comes"

The fact that it has gotten as high as it has really shows the force behind a big hivemind, but there's simply no way retail can keep pumping that much cash. Every day tons of doge is created. Every day the price will drop unless retail keeps buying. There is no end game."
1619269395.0,2021-04-24 09:03:15,1,-1,Value added to anything is only valuable if people put money into it. All cryptos deal with this same fate. What separates doge is the community engagement and the brand recconation that in business gives the right tools for success. All the tech development comes along the way so to say there is not lasting effect of doge is nonsense.
1619271602.0,2021-04-24 09:40:02,0,1,"I didn't have an opinion on it because I didn't care about it then. I don't now for the most part but I had to read about it because of all the ""buy doge to go to the moon"" ads I've been seeing lately.  The reason why it increased so much in price now is Elon Musk. But there is no reason to believe he will keep pumping it to infinity and when the momentum disappears it will devalue. It won't dissapear, but it will decrease in price. And as more coins flood the market, future pumps will be harder and harder to organize.   As I said, I don't know when the decrease will happen because I don't know how much Elon or other celebrities plan to keep pumping it. But they will eventually move on."
1619271838.0,2021-04-24 09:43:58,1,2,"The posts saying market cap doesn’t work like that at all were basically saying the the coin price is what decides market cap though, where as this post kind of implies that market cap decides coin price. The basic idea is right though and the idea that Doges market cap will exceed bitcoins market cap is massively unlikely, even if it’s technically possible. Just look at Bitcoin, the price of a single coin regularly goes up or down by hundreds of dollars. Why do you think the price of doge only goes up or down by fractions of a cent in the same time scale?"

1619272414.0,2021-04-24 09:53:34,0,1,"Also there is an infinite number of doge. Meaning they are just flooding the market each day with doge coin.

1619272077.0,2021-04-24 09:47:57,1,2,Yeah but this is true only if you want to make it to 10$. Making it to 1 would mean it would be 1/7 of bitcoin value wich doesn't sound that weird to me if it gets to be mainstream.

The thing you should be asking yourself is ""what are my investment goals?"" Do you want to buy a car? Save for a house?  Have a comfortable retirement? Once you've figured that out, the next step is to make a plan to reach that goal.  As far as Doge goes, why do you like the coin? If it fell by 80% tomorrow, would you still like it?  Research coins and determine which ones you really believe in aside from the hype and invest in those long term.  That way if they fall in price (and they will... every coin will have dips) you'll still be happy because you're holding coins that you believe in."

The rest of cryptocurrency, tethered in part, to Bitcoin does the same.  There are many, many market “indicators”.  The simplest one i can gift you right now is the [Bitcoin Rainbow Chart](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/).  Study the previous cycles. DYOR. Look up Bitcoin “halvings” and their importance. Watch some “coin bureau” videos on YouTube.  Have fun with charts on glassnode.com  Then come back and tell me if the bear is coming or not.  YMMV.

1619276171.0,2021-04-24 10:56:11,0,2,As long as you did your research. I do hold some I bought for $50 when it was $0.04 NZD just for the memes. I have decided against buying more doge or trying to make a profit from it. I probably won't sell it as the amount is not very high and I am curious to see how high it can go.

I would also say that the fact that it’s mainly being sustained by people who are new to crypto is not a good thing long term. Especially if the whole market dips like it did in 2018 (which it really might at some point towards the end of the year) any coins build on hype are going to be hit particularly hard.  I’d say that a lot of people really aren’t interested in it doing well, and in fact some people would say it would be better for crypto long term of it didn’t do well."
