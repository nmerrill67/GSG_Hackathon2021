1619295034.0,2021-04-24 16:10:34,99,0.93,I just tried Matic/Polygon L2 for Ethereum... WHY did no one tell me about this sooner?!

1619295312.0,2021-04-24 16:15:12,2,38,"Yeah Polygon (MATIC) is pretty amazing.  It is still new but services are popping up daily.  Best way for people who don't know about it to understand is it is like BSC but not a centralized shitchain.  Fast, cheap, and you can bridge assets to/from ETH."
1619295267.0,2021-04-24 16:14:27,1,14,"Well shit, I’m going to have to try this now. I shy away from Uniswap and 1inch for that exact reason"
1619295633.0,2021-04-24 16:20:33,2,13,Polygon will hopefully help solve those gas issues we’re all having
1619296705.0,2021-04-24 16:38:25,0,7,Welcome :) and to think some people choose BSC over eth L2s. BSCs fees are very high compared to polygon! And polygon has aave and opensea. It is a no brainer
1619295252.0,2021-04-24 16:14:12,1,6,"You’re essentially wrapping your tokens on another completely separate network, that adds a layer of trust.  But ya it’s faster and cheaper"
1619296756.0,2021-04-24 16:39:16,1,7,"The polygon ecosystem is growing rapidly too. Curve and Aave on there, sushiswap is on there amd 2 native Dexes,  quickswap and cometh swap. I'm enjoying actually being able to play around with LP and defi without paying triple digits"
1619295315.0,2021-04-24 16:15:15,2,8,Matic is kind of awesome. I believe you can even mint NFTs on Matic without any cost with the NFT minting tool. Matic has been doing its thing for a while now and I'm slightly surprised that it isn't mentioned more often.
1619296743.0,2021-04-24 16:39:03,1,3,"I have been actually thinking about using matic/polygon at the very least to experiment. When i was perusing around their wallet section and bridge is there a way to send erc token for an exchange to the bridge and have it be saved in metamask. Kind of like how the bridge works for BSC  when you want to bridge over erc 20 token to bsc you withdraw from exchange and send to address binance bridge gives you and it get saved in your metamask wallet. Only reason I am asking is because since I have gemini I have free withdrawals , so would rather not pay any extra eth gas fees unless i have to."
1619300881.0,2021-04-24 17:48:01,1,3,What wtf?! This was really nowhere mentioned!
1619295130.0,2021-04-24 16:12:10,1,7,"If true, I have made the same mistake."
1619295272.0,2021-04-24 16:14:32,1,4,This is why matic is one of the only bags I’m holding long term
1619295486.0,2021-04-24 16:18:06,3,5,"Given that Polygon was only announced in February 2021, there are some doubts about the roadmap, how its development will move ahead or which features will be prioritized. That might scare some people off, but it seems to have a professional development team behind it and your experience sounds really positive!"
1619298157.0,2021-04-24 17:02:37,1,2,"I'm kinda new to this, could you explain a bit what MATIC is, maybe even how to use it to avoid fees?"
1619298982.0,2021-04-24 17:16:22,0,2,Yes shill my 2nd biggest bag
1619298983.0,2021-04-24 17:16:23,1,2,I also recommend people check out Celer Network. They just launched their layer 2 finance.
1619299292.0,2021-04-24 17:21:32,1,2,I try to tell people every chance I get.  You should also check out xDAI which is another ethereum sidechain.  You can bridge between the two networks seemlessly.
1619299502.0,2021-04-24 17:25:02,0,2,A lot of people problems are the fact that every time I've checked gas fees to on ramp are 40 usd.  I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but I'm only playing around will small amounts and the fees are impossible for me to pay.
1619299882.0,2021-04-24 17:31:22,1,2,Wait so I can just send my Metamask ETH from the mainnet to Polygon and that's it? HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS
1619295237.0,2021-04-24 16:13:57,1,2,"With both Polygon and Skale (and others) working on scalability, fees should be cheaper like they were before"
1619295619.0,2021-04-24 16:20:19,3,2,Isn't matic just an ETH side chain? Since eth is open source a lot of projects just copied it including bsc. Not necessarily bad but wouldn't they get similar fee problems once everyone uses them? Also are all erc20 tokens usable there?

1619296496.0,2021-04-24 16:34:56,1,1,MATIC is beautiful ;)
1619295252.0,2021-04-24 16:14:12,1,0,I'm still new here and clicking the pieces together.   And... I know right!!! Ethereum is way cooler than I initially thought. Have you looked into NMR? I think there's potential for some really cool market exchanges in the future.
1619296504.0,2021-04-24 16:35:04,0,1,"I don't see the point of going back to mainnet as things are at the moment. DEX working. Aave working. NTF minter working (just learned from the comments).  Starting to look sceptically at my Elrond, Algorand and Cardano bags... but still believe in them so will hold tight lol."
1619296671.0,2021-04-24 16:37:51,1,1,Does anyone have a good tutorial on doing this? I've really just stopped using Uniswap due to high fees.
1619297712.0,2021-04-24 16:55:12,0,1,Now I wonder if I can get polkamon with Matic
1619298043.0,2021-04-24 17:00:43,1,1,"I’ve never heard of this, is it basically a way to send ETH for cheaper?"
1619300861.0,2021-04-24 17:47:41,0,1,"Try out loopring, for me it’s even better!"
1619301935.0,2021-04-24 18:05:35,0,1,"To clarify, you can use Polygon Network on MetaMask? If so, how?"
1619301992.0,2021-04-24 18:06:32,0,1,Is it possible to buy ETH straight into a MATIC enabled network/exchange?
1619302281.0,2021-04-24 18:11:21,0,1,Translation?
1619304238.0,2021-04-24 18:43:58,0,1,If you like Matic then you might like FTM too. It's even faster and cheaper and native layer 1.
1619304509.0,2021-04-24 18:48:29,0,1,"Am I missing something? They don’t nearly have as many tokens to be actually..useful? They don’t have compatibility with 99% of ERC-20 tokens so I’m confused as to why it’s even a big deal? Uniswap has every single ERC-20 possible, and the matic network has less than 100"
1619305946.0,2021-04-24 19:12:26,0,1,Thanks! Didn't know this was possible already. Can maybe finally sell some of those shitcoins held hostage on my ledger
1619306104.0,2021-04-24 19:15:04,0,1,"Aave, Quickswap, and Curve on Polygon have been amazing for me so far.  Transactions are super fast and cost basically nothing, you can convert any token to any other token using QS, and it all integrates seamlessly with metamask. It really offers a glimpse into how great defi could potentially be in the future with mass adoption.  I really hope the whole ecosystem does well."
1619306331.0,2021-04-24 19:18:51,0,1,"Wait until you hear about xDai chain and other L2 solutions that has been popping up recently due to the rising interest in cryptocurrency.  I was going to tell you something about the ease, low price, and speed of transactions using BSC... but it's a risk of triggering ""Binance bad, BSC bad, centralization bad"" echo chamber.  I'm not tech savvy at all; it took me about 6 hours to figure out what tokens and/or coins that I need for bridging these. Last time I tried to bridge and use L2 solutions, it was when exchanging Reddit Moons from xDai chain.  Network is, frankly, not the future. Fast transactions even at Layer 1 is supposed to be the future. Layer 2 works pretty much like toll roads in congested city networks. My first experience with BSC is same like yours. I nearly hit myself in the head for using cryptocurrency for about 3 months and just discovered uses of L2 and bridging from ERC20 network.  That being said, the fees are ridiculously low even compared to the low xDai and BSC fees. Gonna try this one out."
1619306540.0,2021-04-24 19:22:20,0,1,Just wait for their SDK to be fully developed and available. Dapps will be popping up on matics main net so quick and easy
1619306836.0,2021-04-24 19:27:16,0,1,"The only downside is the cost to bridge to Polygon from the ETH chain. After that, it's an absolute joy to use."
1619307567.0,2021-04-24 19:39:27,0,1,"Been a while since I checked, but I thought many coins were not supported, and there were liquidity issues. Am I wrong?"
1619307804.0,2021-04-24 19:43:24,0,1,Is there an ELI5 guide on how to mint an NFT using this cheap alternative?
1619308801.0,2021-04-24 20:00:01,0,1,Anyone looking to learn more about the different layer 2 options emerging on Ethereum should read these 2 amazing posts by /u/Liberosist:  https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mjyvxz/ethereum_scalability_race_april_2021_update/  https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mttr7b/scalability_race_update_2_late_april_2021/
1619309710.0,2021-04-24 20:15:10,0,1,"Meter.io is better than Matic, just saying. Lot of people don’t know about it yet."
1619310193.0,2021-04-24 20:23:13,0,1,the catch is there needs to be more projects built on it first
1619310681.0,2021-04-24 20:31:21,0,1,Simple answer:   **$10 is still a lot in gas fees!!!**
1619310762.0,2021-04-24 20:32:42,0,1,Really noob question but what did you use to get into L2?   I have ETH on L1 and don’t know the best way to get to L2.
1619311012.0,2021-04-24 20:36:52,0,1,"I've been singing their praises to the crickets... Or to be called a shill, 😂"
1619312237.0,2021-04-24 20:57:17,0,1,Good to know will have a look into matic
1619303445.0,2021-04-24 18:30:45,0,0,People don’t listen 🤷🏼‍♂️  They rather buy into hyped coins with zero use rather than looking at existing solutions
1619296733.0,2021-04-24 16:38:53,2,11,Just wish Id used it in march... literally houndres of dollars lost to fees. I feel so stupid and uninformed.
1619300030.0,2021-04-24 17:33:50,0,4,"It is a far less expensive BSC. When i payed .20c fees on BSC, i thought it was cheap. Now, when i pay .20c on BSC, i think it's expensive. And centralised."
1619295492.0,2021-04-24 16:18:12,0,2,Yeah try it and see for yourself. I couldve saved so much had I tried it sooner... :(
1619296569.0,2021-04-24 16:36:09,0,6,"Try it for yourself, you wont go back."
1619301483.0,2021-04-24 17:58:03,1,3,Well it only helps if people use it.  The hardest part has been convincing people to actually use it instead of complaining about high ETH gas fees.  Every tx on MATIC (polygon) is a tx not competing for space on the ETH network.
1619295968.0,2021-04-24 16:26:08,1,4,"Ive read that all Polygon L2 relies on their base Ethereum 1st layer for security and consensus. The 2nd layer is the Polygon Security layer, that uses the Polygon core validators for security and services. 3rd layer = Networks layer makes interoperability between blockchains . 4th layer of polygon makes on-chain and cross-chain smart contracts possible. Am I right? Complex but very smart."
1619298049.0,2021-04-24 17:00:49,1,2,Didnt know Sushiswap integration. Nor Cometh swap  either lol.
1619295709.0,2021-04-24 16:21:49,1,6,Wtf it even got NTF minting options? Can you transfer the NTF back to mainnet?
1619305370.0,2021-04-24 19:02:50,0,1,Iota launching feeless NFTs shortly.
1619301661.0,2021-04-24 18:01:01,1,1,No exchanges that I know of support native withdraws to MATIC.  So you would need to withdraw to your ETH wallet (metamask) and then use the bridge to transfer it from ETH->MATIC.  So there is still that one time cost.  Ideally at some point in the future exchanges would support it directly and you would simply withdraw USDC as an example directly to MATIC network for pennies and avoid the bridge but we aren't there yet.
1619301276.0,2021-04-24 17:54:36,0,1,Totally.
1619295369.0,2021-04-24 16:16:09,0,3,"Try it for yourself. You will feel as frustrated like I am right now. Thats why I wrote this post so hopefully people see it, and can save desperate amounts in gas fees if they like to use DEX's like uniswap etc..."
1619295555.0,2021-04-24 16:19:15,1,4,Yeah I might consider buying the token itself down the road. Right now Im just in heaven using the L2 for like almost free and fast transactions.
1619301418.0,2021-04-24 17:56:58,0,3,MATIC changed its name to polygon in 2021 but the network went live back in 2019.
1619296056.0,2021-04-24 16:27:36,0,2,"It works, thats all I need :D"
1619313183.0,2021-04-24 21:13:03,0,1,"This is my main concern. It seems like a temporary solution. Good for just playing around with DeFi but I wouldn't want to get totally invested in it. Other L2 solutions (particularly zkrollups) are far more secure and advanced from a technical perspective. Polygon claims to also have optimistic and zk rollups, but aren't very clear on when they will produce those. Meanwhile other solutions like StarkEx, Optimism are well underway with dapps that work really well."
1619298439.0,2021-04-24 17:07:19,1,3,"I recommend checking out a quick ""how to"" video on youtube. If you know how to use metamask its very easy. Just gotta send it over to Polygon layer 2 on the Matic bridge, and you are good to go!"

The 2nd layer of Polygonis the Security layer, that handles Polygons security as a service product. 3rd layer in blockchain interoperability and 4th layer of Polygon makes on-chain and cross-chain smart contracts possible. Quite complex stuff. If ive understood it correctly. So it really is a L2 for Eth, but also a chain that works by itself, but relying on eth."
1619296304.0,2021-04-24 16:31:44,1,1,"I think so? You can check for yourself to be sure. I checked the DEX/Quickswap. All my ERC20s like Enjin, Aave etc are there reafy to be traded. And it was basically free to swap that shit all day."

1619298344.0,2021-04-24 17:05:44,0,1,"Kinda yeah. Its like BSC but actually a layer 2 that is decentralized, working and cheaper! Check out a youtube video ""how to"". Its very easy if you know how to use metamask :)"

1619303584.0,2021-04-24 18:33:04,0,1,This is how the majority of dApps will work on Ethereum. Polygon is actually creating a “Cosmos” of Ethereum. More info how it works: https://youtu.be/IijtdpAtOt0
1619297373.0,2021-04-24 16:49:33,1,8,">Sidechains are separate blockchains that run parallel to Ethereum. They have their own miners (often called validators and operators), their own consensus algorithm, and their own bridge to transfer assets to and from the main chain (in this case, Ethereum). Users deposit by locking their assets in a mainnet smart contract. To withdraw back to Ethereum, users initiate an exit on the sidechain, then provide a proof of the exit once it is included in the side chain's history.   >Sidechains are very effective at general computation, and all EVM contracts can be ported directly to run on the sidechain, enabling ETH-like interoperability between contracts on each sidechain, as well as application-level logic. This makes them a common choice for NFT scaling, as applications can migrate with low overheads and development time.  >However, sidechains, like alternative blockchains, usually relax Ethereum's security and decentralization in order to reach their desired scale. Users should be careful not to assume that their ETH assets, while in a sidechain, are just as secure as they are on mainnet: they are only as secure as the consensus algorithm of the sidechain. For sidechains with a limited number of operators and a vulnerable consensus algorithm (i.e. most of them), this could result in the complete theft or ransom of all user assets stored in the sidechain.   >Sidechains also often require additional tooling to be built to support the requisite level of UX.

1619303450.0,2021-04-24 18:30:50,0,1,Bridge fees vary by ETH gas but tend to be in the $20 to $50 range.  It would be best to make one large bridge tx in a single crypto and then use dex to swap on MATIC for <$0.01 per tx in gas fees.  Ideally one or more exchanges won't support native MATIC withdraws (and deposits).  That would be the final piece of the puzzle.

1619282964.0,2021-04-24 12:49:24,2,55,Could someone explain to me like I was a 5 year old what are gas fees and when do they occur?
1619279044.0,2021-04-24 11:44:04,11,115,"Isn’t that why stellar, nano, lite coin and vertcoin etc were introducted? Mainly to mitigate the fees"
1619282160.0,2021-04-24 12:36:00,2,24,"Xlm is good, it’s fast too. I’ve been liking algo as well.   Pick tokens that’s not build on eth."
1619280024.0,2021-04-24 12:00:24,5,82,"ETH gas fees are actually dropping gradually while transactions are remaining high.  It’s not ideal, but it’s not as high as BTC either ($2.50 at the moment)  Edit: it’s $1.20 right now"
1619286595.0,2021-04-24 13:49:55,0,6,"I really hope not. Alt coins sure are after,  but Bitcoin sacrifices speed for  security. Ethereum  has such a extensive ecosystem that their downfall would only be possible  if they ran into major major security issues."
1619307585.0,2021-04-24 19:39:45,1,4,Algo has the best overall package right now .
1619290280.0,2021-04-24 14:51:20,2,11,> I sent a transaction with BTC and it costed me $60.  How is that ?  were you using segwit ?  did it have more than 5 or 10 outputs and inputs ?  even at the peak next block transactions were only 20$
1619280309.0,2021-04-24 12:05:09,3,51,At the moment the gas fee of eth is very low...
1619284338.0,2021-04-24 13:12:18,0,4,What BTC adress did you use? Didnt cost me 60usd to send BTC lol
1619287815.0,2021-04-24 14:10:15,0,5,"The Bitcoin fees are perfectly fine right now. 50 sat/byte gets you in the next block. That will probably be less than 2 dollars.  [https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,fee](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,24h,fee)"

1619292635.0,2021-04-24 15:30:35,1,5,You say ETH is unusable when fees are the lowest they have been in months
1619279046.0,2021-04-24 11:44:06,2,27,Well at least ETH had a solution coming.
1619283094.0,2021-04-24 12:51:34,4,31,"This narrative is so tired. ETH already scales right now, ETH 2 launched 4 months ago, you're just choosing to send transactions and use applications directly on layer 1.  Here's a transaction of Eth from 1 minute ago, it cost $2.83: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8838e6df1ea61349f49bd5c69a551c3ebe4ab0c1266bb8fab0dfc6b22f93f0fe  Still expensive, but a far cry from being unusable."
1619283260.0,2021-04-24 12:54:20,2,21,Computers were pretty expensive at first too. Only rich people and universities could afford them. This seems to be true for a lot of new technologies.

1619286521.0,2021-04-24 13:48:41,1,5,"ETH fees are the lowest they've been all year, and you're complaining now?"
1619283332.0,2021-04-24 12:55:32,1,6,"Bitcoin fees are coming down quickly, and the difficulty adjustment is coming up. You could have just waited for lower fees, since it was a guarantee they were coming.  Also, Lightning works, now, today. Go try it. I recommend Breez wallet, Muun wallet, and Phoenix wallet."
1619281555.0,2021-04-24 12:25:55,1,8,"Just use XLM, like the rest of us"

1619296289.0,2021-04-24 16:31:29,1,2,"Right now you have to pay a premium for using decentralized technology. It sucks, but ultimately these technologies were designed for decentralization NOT eliminating fees. Hopefully it gets better in the future and there's an option that's both decentralized and low fee.  It's like the early days of the internet, where you had to pay by the minute for a crappy 56k connection. You're paying a premium to use burgeoning technology."
1619296743.0,2021-04-24 16:39:03,0,2,"Yes, yes, yes, but IOTA. Fees just doesn't make any sense."
1619297816.0,2021-04-24 16:56:56,0,2,Lightning is already here.... I use it with Bitrefill to buy daily stuff in a freakin third world country at 1-3 sats fees.
1619301590.0,2021-04-24 17:59:50,0,2,"With properly decentralized crypto, it is not possible to scale on base layer. Bitcoin is the most decentralized crypto currency.  Crypto currencies have 3 properties: Decentralization, security, and speed. If you want to increase the speed on base layer you would need to compromise with decentralization and security. This is the reason Bitcoin doesn’t want to make any modifications in the base layer for scaling.   The reason Lightning Network is not yet widely adopted is because no one wants to use their Bitcoin to buy a coffee.  Any money starts as a store of value (currently where Bitcoin is at), then a medium of exchange (already happening for larger transactions on base layer, smaller transactions with Lightning), and then an unit of account ( takes time for adoption but some companies like Tesla already accepting Bitcoin as a payment)."
1619282127.0,2021-04-24 12:35:27,0,6,"Really? I used Ethereum all morning, it worked great."
1619283330.0,2021-04-24 12:55:30,1,5,This is why I hold on to my very few nanos. It solves these problems of btc and other crypto as a currency.
1619283522.0,2021-04-24 12:58:42,2,6,I really don't get this. It cost me £2.50 for eth transaction coinbase to wallet this morning.
1619286103.0,2021-04-24 13:41:43,4,8,"This is exactly why I don't own a single BTC or ETH, I don't believe in them for the very long term. and so far ADA, XRP, etc have made me more profits too."
1619286205.0,2021-04-24 13:43:25,0,3,Have you ever heard of $NANO? Instant transactions with no fees. Check it out. Imagine paying fees per transaction.
1619283563.0,2021-04-24 12:59:23,0,2,Let the shit-coin shilling in comments commence.
1619295655.0,2021-04-24 16:20:55,0,2,\>eth 2.0  When's half life 3 coming out again?
1619288452.0,2021-04-24 14:20:52,0,2,"You can always use XRP, great coin, fast transactions and low fees"
1619289073.0,2021-04-24 14:31:13,0,2,Maybe try Feeless Coins like IOTA or NANO?
1619287076.0,2021-04-24 13:57:56,0,1,Thats why you need to move to LTC I think. Its a top 10 coin with faster and cheaper everything.
1619289131.0,2021-04-24 14:32:11,1,1,Man does anyone know about IOTA. I feel like im taking crazy pills. (Zoolander reference)
1619301939.0,2021-04-24 18:05:39,0,1,Doge coin is coming

1619279176.0,2021-04-24 11:46:16,3,-3,BTC is like the gold of the crypto currency as it was the first crypto to be used. Other than that it is SHIT crypto.  ETH is like the silver plus it has some functionality but failed in the transaction fees as a gas.  My point of view is that there is some crypto out there that can smash and destroy these two cryptos by their much more advanced technology and its speed!!
1619282600.0,2021-04-24 12:43:20,0,1,"BTC has great brand value if anything. ETH, in my opinion, has a great team/organization pushing the envelope of what a cryptocurrency should be. Neither are at their end state and both could crash spectacularly."
1619284311.0,2021-04-24 13:11:51,1,1,Try to use some L2 solutions like loopring to send and receive money.  Still wonders me that people don’t use them more often
1619285411.0,2021-04-24 13:30:11,0,1,Maybe we'd be better off using DOGE as gas.
1619286585.0,2021-04-24 13:49:45,1,1,"BTC and ETH are just the big ones everybody knows, but I don't see them being the future in the long-term.  They're serving their purpose, but we need faster and cheaper transactions which use less hardware resources.  Try running an Ethereum node and see how much CPU and RAM it takes.  You can run Bitcoin Core and even a CPU miner active on a few cores and have a more usable machine.  I love what Ethereum is but I think it's growing far too quickly to sustain what it's become.  As for transaction fees, it's still cheaper to convert to something like Litecoin, transfer that, and convert it back."
1619287142.0,2021-04-24 13:59:02,1,1,"Transact with ETH and BTC is a painfull experience that I always try to avoid.  They were the firsts, but they are outdated."
1619296560.0,2021-04-24 16:36:00,0,1,"Yeah I started moving my money into better built blockchain tech like Cardano, Polkadot, Stellar, and Algorand. I just don’t feel good about ETH. BTC on the other hand has a much more limited supply and wider adoption so I look at it as a store of value, nothing more."
1619301787.0,2021-04-24 18:03:07,0,1,"At the risk of being crucified by everyone here, I think Doge solves that exact problem."

1619288612.0,2021-04-24 14:23:32,1,0,I moved 300 USD of crypto between three exchanges yesterday for a total of 2 USD in network fees with... dogecoin
1619279104.0,2021-04-24 11:45:04,0,1,"I agree with your point, but atm I don't know which protocol is better, or whether it being better in one sense or another even matters when it comes to what people will end up using."
1619279335.0,2021-04-24 11:48:55,0,1,I had a transaction go through last night for 0.000316 btc. As long as you have some patience you can get away with lower fees although it’s still pretty high compared to other cryptos.
1619281248.0,2021-04-24 12:20:48,0,1,"I think it’s widely accepted btc as a currency is not ideal, albeit lightning helps and eth is a bit of a victim of its own success. The reaction to defi has been far greater than the network can cope with, but its going in the right direction."
1619281919.0,2021-04-24 12:31:59,0,1,"I’m genuinely curious what people think of Decred as a possibly upgraded version of BTC. The proof of stake consensus should help to lower fees and costs of mining and keep mining from being taken over by big companies. Also, stakeholders vote on the project and its direction. I do hold and will always hold BTC though. Just looking at other investments"
1619283266.0,2021-04-24 12:54:26,0,1,"Yeah, all that BTC and ETH collected at the dip have to sit at the exchange for quite some time."
1619287155.0,2021-04-24 13:59:15,0,1,"To be fair, Ethereum is a massive network with many coins that have different uses. Don’t like ETH? Trade one of the other dozens of coins on the network. Unlike Bitcoin, you invest in ETH for the network and the technology behind it."
1619287187.0,2021-04-24 13:59:47,0,1,"I usually trade it into EOS which costs less than a dollar to send. It's fast too. When it arrives to the exchange, I trade EOS into BTC/USDT and probably don't lose (I' might even make a small profit) as much as the BTC/ETH transaction fee would have been."
1619287226.0,2021-04-24 14:00:26,0,1,This is why the gravity bridge and Bitcoin bridge for the cosmos network is going to be such a great tool for our entire ecosystem. Bitcoin is always king and Eth is one of the most important projects in our space. The IBC will change this.

1619291350.0,2021-04-24 15:09:10,0,1,Was anybody buying crypto so that they could use it? No it’s a store of value that is somewhat protected from inflation which we are about to see
1619292956.0,2021-04-24 15:35:56,0,1,"Facts. I do not want to further invest in them. Especially Bitcoin has become nothing but a normal paper. You invest to make money, not because you REALLY wanna buy stuff with it. *BRUH*"
1619293386.0,2021-04-24 15:43:06,0,1,Stellar would be your answers probably I do think this is just due to how early we all are btc and eth still have a lot of growing to do
1619293632.0,2021-04-24 15:47:12,0,1,"You still live in the past brother! **ETHEREUM Layer 2 is already LIVE**, what are you whining about?  You can use 10 dollar for the fee to send all your Eth to e.g. **Polygon/Matic** and enjoy transactionspeeds at 2-3 second that cost like less than 0,1 cent.  Don't believe me? Check for yourself :)"
1619294277.0,2021-04-24 15:57:57,1,1,exactly. both are nice to have but I couldn't buy anything with them unless I loose alot through the transfer. I have high hopes for Eth2.0 to eliminate this problem. I love to buy and hodl these coins but it wouldn't be bad to actually be able to buy something with them.
1619295109.0,2021-04-24 16:11:49,0,1,Say hi to litecoin
1619296122.0,2021-04-24 16:28:42,0,1,the next biggest thing will build on btc making it cheap and scalable. might even be eth but doesnt look like it

1619297072.0,2021-04-24 16:44:32,0,1,"I want to continue buying ETH weekly to dollar cost average but its too expensive to buy and transfer from exchange to wallet so I haven't bought any ETH in the last few weeks, this is for sure holding back new ATH's as many average investors are surely in the same boat."
1619297711.0,2021-04-24 16:55:11,0,1,"Agreed. I like the defi cases of eth buy it is literally unusable. I'd taken out oasis loans in the past and wanted to pay them off. 1. Swap one of my shitcoins for Dai - stung with $60 eth fee. 2. Swap another shitcoin for Dai - another$60 fee. 3. Go on oasis, another $60 to allow oassis to use dai. 4. Another fee to actually pay the loan off. 5 another fee to withdraw my crypto out of oasis. Paying $100's dollars for simple tasks  Wtf"
1619297891.0,2021-04-24 16:58:11,0,1,"Ethereum just raised the gas fee and we are starting to go through the transaction backlog.  $1 is still too much for a transaction fee imo, but the gas limit increase should provide some relief and another gas limit increase could come into play in the coming months if needed  Layer 2 solutions are also here now and more per.anant relief is coming soon.

However you shouldn’t be moving around BTC in the first place. You could convert it to a cheaper coin, move that coin and then turn it back into BTC for a fraction of the cost of moving BTC. Your knowledge on fees needs to be worked on my friend. Buying and holding them for their value is a solid move.

1619309242.0,2021-04-24 20:07:22,0,1,For BTC a transfer only cost me $17  You know there are ways to reduce your fees right? Not everyone pays the same fees if you shop around.  For example you can use exchanges like Gemini which provide free withdrawals or other exchanges which have low withdrawal fees.  Are you using a wallet that supports Native Segwit addresses? Those usually give you cheaper fees also.

To transfer around exchanges I've been using XLM for the speed.  That bloat in fees though is built into the algorithm, as the mining rewards are reduced by the minting of new coins, the difference is supposed to be made up by the TX fees.  The time it takes to mine is also directly related to difficulty, this was all pointed out in the dark ages of crypto in discussions and the can was kicked down the road  Also anyone who has been in eth like me, since the testnet, remembers them talking about POS. It's been the miners boogeyman for the last half decade.  I remember when ZEC came out and was supposed to be the new thing, lightning fast TX, with the privacy of monero, where no one could track your blockchain habits. (Like xmr) and we see how that turned out. I haven't seen zec anywhere in awhile.  LTC was the back in the day, lightning chain compared to btc but even that has fallen down.  I'm digging these smart chain coins on BNB. It reminds me of the early days of eth, does anyone remember the dragons thst you could grow and have battle? Omg I would be a millionaire with the eth I spent.  but there's way more money in crypto now. Scams are rampant, and going into trust wallet and pancake swap make me feel like I walked into the casino, and that's how I explain bnb to non crypto people.  Aside from mining eth. I don't think I'll use it anymore. I had genuinely hoped with smart contracts and Dapps thst it could be used to facilitate real estate transactions and displace escrow. And thst we could move house ownership and taxes etc, into blockchain,  but I think the many problems inherent in these algorithms is why that will never be   Whats really needed is a cross-crypto ledger algorithm with no difficulty increase between blocks and the reward tied to be just a little higher than power consumption. One coin to rule them all so to speak. That spits confirmed tx out to the various chains."

1619287931.0,2021-04-24 14:12:11,4,19,I think Algorand has the best shot of solving the trilemma. I can't see Ethereum successfully transitioning.

MATIC for example is a great L2 solution to ETH but the devs still have backdoors into every smart contract and full decentralization of the DAO has not been achieved yet. (might be out of date but this was true in Nov 2020). Its also hard to trust these new DEXs and other dapps on all the altchains as well, since their gov tokens are not well disbursed and so very few actors hold huge %s of the voting power.  If you are going to put 5-6 figures into defi then ETH is way safer.  BTC is the same way, its been around for over a decade and the governance of it has been very consistent and the community is strong. cant find another coin that has the same claim."

Problem with that is we then run the very real risk of dampening innovation but more importantly seeing control hoarded by the few that control the creation of the regulatory framework creation.   That will likely lead to a situation like in tradition finance were there are the few that have the advantage and the rest get the scraps they are allowed to have. Sure, it brings stability...... but while the cost might not seem like much, the reality is its a huge cost against what the pioneers saw as the true potential for the sector!   Hopefully, with the introduction of things like DeFi its creating a situation where the sector is moving towards a fully decentralised model that is capable of being peer to peer and once that is embraced widespread its going to be near impossible to capture and control."

The hack affected a now obsolete part of the Blockchain and it's extremely unlikely anything remotely similar to that could happen again, considering the growth of contributers.  The ethereum core node (geth) can easily tell you that. I'm not sure why you think otherwise.  What promises did it make that it can't keep?

In 2013 people were panicking as it crashed, 2017 people panicked, but if you held on to your coins and just stayed calm 2021 feels great even right now.

Platform launches next week, tier 1 exchange listing coming right afterwards. They have announced partnerships and real properties lined up to use their platform recently. The reason I say why it could survive a bear market is that the requirement for staking is only 1000 euros and not based on amount of coins owned and any asset that uses the platform pays a fee and 33% of that goes to all who are staking. It is completely unreliant on whatever the rest of crypto is doing, the property owners pay a flat fee and those who are staking receive their portion of 33% of those fees. Sure it will start out with pretty small staking rewards but if it really takes off and they keep listing new assets eventually it will become speculative and people will just be purchasing the coin for where they think the staking might be at in a few years. Idk look into it man, its kinda a totally different sort of crypto and if launch goes smoothly I think it will shoot up bull or bear market.."

If you are invested in something that has a promising future and you've done the research on it, usually holding it has proven to be successful. A lot of investors buying BTC for $1000+ in 2013, buying it for nearly $20k in 2017, would be better off if they'd just held instead of bailing out.  None of us know when this cycle will hit a brick wall. But even if it does, it's not the end of the world so long as you are invested in the right projects, if they are decent projects they'll most likely bounce back and then some as more investors get behind them.  I'm not buying anything, and I'm not selling anything either. Time will prove me right or wrong and since it's money I can afford to kiss goodbye if it all goes 100% tits up (unlikely to happen but you never know) then I'm going to sit tight and if we do take a long hiatus I can always buy more and increase my holdings with the income I get from the daily grind, savings, etc.  I don't think this is over yet, and here we are seeing everyone complaining that the market is all over, that it's finished, that everything is going to be worthless. We had this a couple of times in 2017 and in 2013 too. A lot of early adopters thought BTC was dead after the 2011 crash. All they had to do was hang on and wait."

It depends on what you're invested in, and whether those projects (ie. alt coins) have a promising future.  In the end it's all about risk analysis and making decisions based upon research. Pick projects that have a promising future (ie. Ethereum, Monero, Chainlink, Dot, etc) and you won't have to worry as much.  Pick random moonshot coins, and you may not do so well.

I don't see much difference between the sub now and during the hype at the end of 2017, but I see more of a difference between now and 2019-20 when the sub was a lot quieter after a lot of people had given up on crypto during the bear market.

Simply by setting stop losses and off loading a percentage/all of their investments at a breakeven/just below breakeven price point, followed by reinvesting at a price below their previous price. Irregardless of your personal feelings towards a coin or whether or not there is an objectively positive outlook for its project.

You can simply hold chainlink or ethereum and ride the dips, even when the dips drop below your initial investment and you would likely be just fine as we have seen. Or you could mitigate your losses and see greater returns by using the tools available irregardless of the faith you place in any one coin."

The people on Reddit are incredibly eager to help, the YouTubers do daily updates on market news and activity, every major project has its own subreddit with people who love the project...     I'm not trying to pretend I know everything after only \~3 months of research and investment, but the information is certainly all available. People not taking their investments seriously and expecting easy gains from the project they got shilled by DjKoolAiD from TikTok are going to get lucky or get burned.     Edit: Also not saying we shouldn't help new people who are getting into crypto. Just saying that you can lead a horse to water, but if he doesn't drink he's probably not all that thirsty."

So many people don't even know what a market cap is, I saw a thread earlier explaining how if you go down 50% you need a 100% gain to recover it and all the comments where from people who didn't know that. Like there is just alot more dumb people that aren't as genuinely interested in it now, I'm not even talking about the tech just basic knowledge people should know.

1619249395.0,2021-04-24 03:29:55,1,2,"Yeah, it's possible to cut losses/increase accumulation in a market that has a predictable cycle.  A bull run necessitates a bear market to follow it.  This is why this time it's never different.  Why can't it be different? It's just the dynamics of assets being overbought to such a degree by a hoard of new buyers, there's always going to be a protracted sell-off as these new buyers exit the market and smart money sees their chart indicators telling them they're in the sell zone.   Given all that, I don't really understand why people don't take advantage of such a predictable market cycle and accumulate crypto by selling a good proportion of their crypto in a bull market (while accumulating in a bear market).  It's not about being perfect, but being good.  You can't catch the top or bottom, but you can know what season you're in and act accordingly."

If you know the market is cyclical, why buy near the top? Why even hodl your entire stack as you approach the top? We know when we're in a bull market (once it's established).  We know when we're in a bear market (once it's established).  Either we believe ""this time it's different"" (it never is), or we observe the fact that a bull will follow a bear, and a bear will follow a bull.

The only exception is skipped proposers, which are rare. Combined with EIP 1559, this will massively improve Ethereum's UX   The more consistent transaction schedule should help POS miners be more certain and consistent in their revenue from transaction volume.

1619217363.0,2021-04-23 18:36:03,0,2,There's something deeply satisfying about owning whole coins. It's like having the volume on a number ending in 5 or 0. It just feels complete.
1619223687.0,2021-04-23 20:21:27,0,2,I'm on my way to 1 eth slowly too! Only a cple pennies to go!!!

1619196448.0,2021-04-23 12:47:28,0,3,Congrats on that mate no where near getting 1 ETH... one day though !
1619196299.0,2021-04-23 12:44:59,2,3,Don't forget you'll need more ETH to transfer your ETH to your wallet lol
1619193826.0,2021-04-23 12:03:46,0,4,Congrats! I’m still a ways away but I’m working on it. Here’s an  upmoon to add to your collection :)
1619193905.0,2021-04-23 12:05:05,0,2,"anyone else have to buy up to a whole coin? I remember when I first bought ethereum, it was my only coin I didnt own all the way. it drove me crazy not having the whole coin xD"
1619194442.0,2021-04-23 12:14:02,1,2,Congrats! One day I’ll be in the single coin club!
1619195626.0,2021-04-23 12:33:46,0,2,Lucky!!! I'm like 98.9 % away from my first ETH but I'll keep your advice in mind. Thanks for sharing
1619196692.0,2021-04-23 12:51:32,1,2,Now try to spend it and see that it costs an arm and a leg. Future is expensive I guess 🤷‍♂️

1619199851.0,2021-04-23 13:44:11,0,1,Ha I should’ve done this tbf. As usual I pursued out when I should’ve doubled down. But I do still think there’s room to go down further.

1619198519.0,2021-04-23 13:21:59,1,1,"Well done! Are ya aiming for more ETH or on to another stack? I tend to DCA, but recently have also toyed with simply parking at least some of my DCA as USD in an exchange (weekly or monthly) to save for these unpredictable dips and increase buying power."
1619198620.0,2021-04-23 13:23:40,0,1,Man I need to do this.  But I has no monies
1619198900.0,2021-04-23 13:28:20,0,1,"Grats, good on you"
1619198908.0,2021-04-23 13:28:28,0,1,"Aaah shit, I thought before I went to bed: shall I sell my .15 ETH, because it might not stay here that long. But I had a mofo thought: what if it goes up while you are asleep(i sometimes even think to myself: sell all before bed haha)... So I kept it 😂 would have had more ETH now... But still far from 1 eth. By the way: congrats to you!"
1619199758.0,2021-04-23 13:42:38,0,1,"I'm waiting on a dip to btc to wrap up my last .92, then it's the moon!!!"
1619199809.0,2021-04-23 13:43:29,0,1,its the small victories that count. Good for you

1619201969.0,2021-04-23 14:19:29,0,1,"I didn't think I'd own a whole eth for awhile, but my conviction has grown, I've put more of my network into crypto and own a few now. Now a whole BTC? We'll see if in the bear market the prices goes to 20K or something, but otherwise not sure if that will happen in my lifetime."
1619202581.0,2021-04-23 14:29:41,0,1,I did the exact same thing today and love to see this Congrats on your achievement 😎

1619204955.0,2021-04-23 15:09:15,1,1,wow! next goal: 1 BTC? :) happy for you OP
1619205369.0,2021-04-23 15:16:09,0,1,"Congrats on your first one, I've just started climbing my ETH ladder in the last month but today's dip seemed like a good sign to increase up another .06 of an ETH. Hoping to hit the 1 in the near future."
1619205852.0,2021-04-23 15:24:12,0,1,Welcome to the club richy rich.
1619206245.0,2021-04-23 15:30:45,0,1,This is a really good idea I never thought of lol
1619206309.0,2021-04-23 15:31:49,0,1,Good Job and keep buying the f**king dip!
1619206858.0,2021-04-23 15:40:58,0,1,"If you print a model of Vitalik to hug musk, it adds 15% instantly."
1619206981.0,2021-04-23 15:43:01,0,1,I shot  up from .2 BTC to .5 BTC by buying the dips but also selling the profits from the pumps afterwards.  I am running out of fiat for this dip though...  Might stop buying until a momentum shift.
1619207260.0,2021-04-23 15:47:40,1,1,"how are you ""pulling $20 here and there"" , won't you have to deal with big taxes from all of those little pulls?"
1619207574.0,2021-04-23 15:52:54,0,1,Nice humblebrag! Congrats 👏
1619209013.0,2021-04-23 16:16:53,0,1,I have 0 ETH... literally none. I’m doing great over here. 🙌🏻
1619209355.0,2021-04-23 16:22:35,0,1,"excellent post, this is the way."
1619209496.0,2021-04-23 16:24:56,0,1,currently sat with .78 neo along side other coins.. due to the price of neo falling and requirements of transferring only whole coins its just sat there.. kind of stuck.. how would anybody even go about buying the .22 ? 🤣 I'm hoping it goes up but everytime I see it I can't help thinking.. thats a lesson learned the hard way..
1619209704.0,2021-04-23 16:28:24,0,1,I did the same but for me was .30. I feel proud .
1619210566.0,2021-04-23 16:42:46,0,1,Congrats
1619210758.0,2021-04-23 16:45:58,0,1,"What is your strategy for this? I want to do it, but also want to just hold and get staking rewards or interest on my coins. I know risks, Yada Yada. But if I'd have taken profits on say ltc and link I'd have been up a few hundred I could have thrown back into eth or btc.    I've been thinking, sell at all time high. Doesn't matter if it goes up more because it will certainly go down and retest support below that ath. When it goes down some or market dips, buy more. But I know timing the market is hard, and you have to account for fees even minimal ones.    What are all of your strategies for this? I guess all in all I would get more interest from stablecoins anyway after switching to stablecoins. I check a few times a day but not all day everyday but I generally know roughly where the market sentiment is at. What does everyone else think?"
1619211680.0,2021-04-23 17:01:20,0,1,congrats dude!
1619212446.0,2021-04-23 17:14:06,0,1,I have .999 of an XMR
1619212509.0,2021-04-23 17:15:09,0,1,Does having 2 doge count? If it helps I also got an ETC from someone
1619212536.0,2021-04-23 17:15:36,0,1,I’m at about half of one but my goal is to have 1 whole ETH coin. I bought a tenth of a coin today so at what feels like a cheap price.
1619212906.0,2021-04-23 17:21:46,0,1,"What's funny is whenever I look after hearing about a dip on here, I'm ever so slightly up and have missed the dip or it's a small dip. I don't really look when I hear ATH or whatever though lol"
1619213012.0,2021-04-23 17:23:32,0,1,Congrats!
1619214902.0,2021-04-23 17:55:02,0,1,That is great news. Looking forward to my 1ETH some day. One thing i fear is that at a rise i am to scared to sell thinking that it might not dip low enough to buy more. I get the saying what goes up must come down but ETH has been consistently over $2000 it doesn’t feel like it will drop any time soon.
1619214954.0,2021-04-23 17:55:54,0,1,Last year I bought 1 Eth at $135. It was stagnant for a while and I got impatient and sold it for $130. Feeling pretty dumb lately.
1619215272.0,2021-04-23 18:01:12,0,1,Congrats on the ETH!
1619215325.0,2021-04-23 18:02:05,0,1,This is how you do it.
1619216089.0,2021-04-23 18:14:49,0,1, Been slowly working on the same thing over the last few months. Congrats! And with spare cash also been working on having a 100 of the smaller coins just in case you know ;)
1619217368.0,2021-04-23 18:36:08,0,1,This is the way.
1619217635.0,2021-04-23 18:40:35,0,1,awesome work mate!
1619217872.0,2021-04-23 18:44:32,0,1,I and working at my full eth. Hope it doesn't outpace me!
1619218607.0,2021-04-23 18:56:47,0,1,"Dude congrats! I just recently got into crypto as an investment (been buying Bitcoin to use for sports gambling website) but my goal is to own 1 ETH as well. Currently own ETH, BAT & ALGO."
1619219827.0,2021-04-23 19:17:07,0,1,Congratulations. I bought my first a few days ago with some of the profits I made from Doge. I moved the last bit of Doge in today to start working on my second one.
1619219882.0,2021-04-23 19:18:02,0,1,I did the same today too! One whole Eth!
1619220143.0,2021-04-23 19:22:23,0,1,Now you just need 31 more 😅
1619220165.0,2021-04-23 19:22:45,0,1,Get your profit or you can use stop-limit to protect yourself against dips.
1619220729.0,2021-04-23 19:32:09,0,1,Congratulations on joining the 1 ETH club!
1619221441.0,2021-04-23 19:44:01,0,1,"Do you have an advice on how often or at what % profit you should consistently pull out profit at and vice versa with buying back in?? I am always reluctant to sell and wait to buy back in because A. never know when it will or if it will dip and B. if it does it’s hard/impossible to choose when the exact right time is. I just try to buy more whenever it’s on a big dip or down a decent % on the day, week etc. but I’ve only been in it for about 6 months."
1619221859.0,2021-04-23 19:50:59,0,1,"Bro, I told you to come to me if you ever need some ETH. Now I’m tapped!"

1619222640.0,2021-04-23 20:04:00,0,1,"Congratulations!! And thank you for the insights. I’ve been thinking along the same lines and going to put it into practise soon. (Just starting out with crypto, wish me luck!) 🙏"

1619224891.0,2021-04-23 20:41:31,0,1,Great job mate! When are you getting a pair of ETH :)
1619225100.0,2021-04-23 20:45:00,0,1,"Nice, I’m very close to 1. Could technically get it right now but I’m scaling in a little slowly just in case the dip keeps on dipping"
1619226418.0,2021-04-23 21:06:58,0,1,Just remember to hodl. I started out in 2018 $20 here and there and I've sold positions more than once and have a small amount of regret. I wouldn't have life changing money either way but the lost opportunity is enough to make me second guess any and all sales
1619227476.0,2021-04-23 21:24:36,0,1,"Nice, I'm on my way too."
1619227650.0,2021-04-23 21:27:30,0,1,Congrats I’ll get there soon FIAT is kinda tight these days haha
1619228924.0,2021-04-23 21:48:44,0,1,"I remember when Bitcoin was like $3k and unfortunately I did not have the finance to purchase a full one back then, and now it’s 60k (well technically 49k dip but it’ll be back up)...  So I took the opportunity to purchase 1 full ETH...  Imagine when ETH reaches 60k (from $2.5k)...  Now also imagine how high BTC will be when ETH reaches $60k 🤑"
1619229005.0,2021-04-23 21:50:05,0,1,What are some good somewhat stable coins? No dollar equivalents though. XLM has seemed to smooth out the crashes somewhat.

1619230574.0,2021-04-23 22:16:14,0,1,Congrats!! Same! I'm working my way there too
1619231059.0,2021-04-23 22:24:19,2,1,"So if you withdraw into a stable coin, do you have to pay taxes on that like you would with USD? Ive been wondering this for a while and havent been able to find a concise answer."
1619232253.0,2021-04-23 22:44:13,0,1,"I too only need 0.18 ETH to get a full 0.18ETH on my wallet.   Jokes aside, nice one OP hope you’ll have a lot more in the future."
1619232822.0,2021-04-23 22:53:42,0,1,Congrats OP. Indeed it must be a great feeling. Im also working my way to 1ETH but through mining as opposed to trading for it.  Though I may trade here and there on the way to expedite.
1619235528.0,2021-04-23 23:38:48,0,1,"Nice, I only have .25 ethereum but for every paycheck I get over this summer I'm gonna put in 25%. Get paid twice a month, usually around 400 bucks per check. 200 a month until I get to one full eth, though I'll probably continue to buy more and more. I'm 18 rn and I'm hoping that by my late 20's this will pay off lol, good luck boys"
1619235715.0,2021-04-23 23:41:55,0,1,And here is me who is nearing my first whole ETH spent on gas fees :(
1619236067.0,2021-04-23 23:47:47,0,1,"Wait, so are you doing the opposite of DCA then?   Are you taking out 20$ here and 50$ there when you see a downtrend?   Shouldn't you be buying more when the market starts to correct?   Or are you taking money out on a constant basis and then putting it back into the market when it starts to tank?   I'm new to crypto and things."
1619236185.0,2021-04-23 23:49:45,0,1,"Well done, hope to get a full ETH eventually :)"

So everyone is already at a 10x by now.  Not hating. Just my 0.02 sats  Edit: if reaching 1 ETH was your goal you should still feel good about yourself. Never compare yourself to others.

Sure the market is all speculation at this point but 50T only seems possible to me when crypto is so ingrained in daily life that we can't live without it (but completely unnoticeable to most). We aren't even close to that kind of mass adoption.   ETH at a 5T market cap I can actually see in 10 years, but at the cost of bitcoin stabilizing as a true store of value much sooner (think gold). Bitcoin can only increase so much until it becomes an actual store of value (one that can outpace inflation at a stable pace) that doesn't increase ten times every four years."

1619285978.0,2021-04-24 13:39:38,2,2,When ETH consumes too many fiber rich foods it gets...well...gassy.   I purely commented out of an inescapable need to tell horrible dad jokes...and I would like to see a layman’s explanation. My understanding is that gas is just ETH burned as a transaction fee....with that being said I eagerly await the answer from somebody that knows that the hell they are talking about as I am simply full of gas.
1619285907.0,2021-04-24 13:38:27,0,2,Cost of doing business. (Transactions)
1619285933.0,2021-04-24 13:38:53,0,2,The fees you pay to the network for transactions. Anyone correct me if im wrong
1619285896.0,2021-04-24 13:38:16,1,0,"Gas refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute specific operations on the Ethereum network…Gas [is] paid in Ethereum’s native currency, ether (ETH). Gas prices are denoted in Gwei, which itself is a denomination of ETH – each Gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH (10-9 ETH).”  As background, the gas limit restricts the amount of data and computational effort required by miners to process a single block on the network. The cost of each unit of gas in terms of ETH is decided by the user, who can set a high or low gas price. Miners prioritize transactions and operations with high gas prices (and hence, higher total transaction fees) to maximize the rewards they earn on the network.   Due to finite block space and an ever-increasing volume of on-chain activity, gas fees have been soaring on Ethereum. Depending on the transaction type, associated fee can range from a few bucks to hundreds of dollars."

1619286099.0,2021-04-24 13:41:39,1,4,"Does that mean if gas is high, the miners are getting higher amounts of eth than before?"
1619286275.0,2021-04-24 13:44:35,1,2,So high gas fees are good for miners but bad for investors?
1619287742.0,2021-04-24 14:09:02,0,2,Thanks for a simple and easy to understand explanation!
1619286759.0,2021-04-24 13:52:39,1,2,"So it’s a flat fee, not a percentage of the transaction amount? That’s good to know."

Some might argue that the high fees prevent the network from being overloaded, but I think it'd be better to make the network more scalable instead of just making it prohibitively expensive. ETH 2.0 will switch the network to Proof of Stake, so there won't be any miners. Gas fees should also be much more reasonable."
1619287302.0,2021-04-24 14:01:42,1,2,"That is my understanding. After I used ETH once to move about $20 and paid almost $10 extra in fees, I switched to using mostly LTC and BCH. But there are some transactions that absolutely require ETH fees, I just don't conduct those transactions now. I am only 2 + months into crypto but quickly learned current ETH gas costs are high. They ate expected to go down in the future (hopefully). If you are buying certain coins off Uniswap (etc)  I think u have to pay ETH gas fees, but you would need to consult with someone who has more knowledge as I am not investing large enough sums of money that paying gas fees for small amounts of coins off Uniswap is a smart move right now."

So if it costs lets say 30usd per transaction, you end up with 30usd of fees to send, then very low fees inside the L2, then another 30usd to get them back to L1 right ?  \- Until there's payment gateways directly in this L2, i'm condemned to have to transact my gained interests back to L1 every time i want to use them, right ?   \- With the multiplication of L2 concurrent solutions, does it mean everything will have to be sent back to L1 and then to the other kind of L2 every time you need to for some reason? That would result in 2 L1 transactions of high fees...     For example, let's consider the practical case of parking USDC savings to gain interests, and wanting to retrieve these interests let's say once per month.    I'd pay a one time transaction to send them from L1 to Polygon with the high L1 fees.    Then I'd place them in AAVE for almost no fees.    Then I'd be able once a month to retrieve the earned USDC interests once a month for almost no fees from AAVE. So far so good.   But then, how do I get these into a usable gateway without having to pay a L1 transaction? (ex Coinbase, Binance, Cryptocom that have cards I can load and use for my daily expanses) Does any of these support this L2 layer?    My understanding is that I can't, making it not worth it unless you're planning of doing a lot of trading inside one of the few services supporting that L2.    But for most people looking for a simple setup like my example, you'd end up paying as much fees if not more than just staying on L1. But maybe i'm missing something?  🐷"

If you have a binance account, you can pretty much get anycoin onto BSC , with very little fees.  And bridge it further to Polygon using the above bridge. As always, try it out with a small test txn. Once the xpollinate bridge loads, you can see the exit liquidity on each chain, for large txn ensure the chain has exit liquidity. It keeps changing as and when people keep using the bridge.

Quite nice to have exposure to a commodity so unrelated to crypto there too.    And then a UST-BUSD pool on wheat which is like 110% - and you can stake the wheat token for 250% odd.    The ANC-UST pool is fun too - pays like 110% in ANC (obviously IL considerations, but it has been pretty stable for now), then use a bluna loan on anchor to borrow UST to pair with my ANC rewards and compound the LP   All in all, think people definitely miss out on Yield opportunities."

1619273447.0,2021-04-24 10:10:47,1,3,"So staking is exactly as you do with ADA - it will be single token provision and will be used to secure a Proof of Stake network, in return you are paid interest in the form of the native token. As you are with ADA - most if not all defi projects offer this   Yield farming is just like liquidity pools - and you are paid out a percentage in interest for providing liquidity. I am ot sure if you know about impermanent loss? If not look it up. But very simply if you provide 2 tokens in a 50/50 split, if demand for one is higher (eg its price goes up), you will end up rebalanced say 60/40 toward the less valued token, this is due to the fact people are trading these pairs with the liquidity you provided. Therefore if one token sky rockets and the other doesn't - you will lose out vs holding (impermanent loss - called impermanent because it only becomes a loss when you sell (they could rebalance should the price fall).    Put simply it is often good to aim for two tokens which may stay relatively similar to one another to avoid impermanent loss. As a result I mainly do stablecoin farming (they stay the same price), or use things like cake-bnb which are generally pretty correlated.    Most the time the high apy % paid offsets the IL, but it is worth factoring in.     Lending/borrowing - don't worry about it then, depending on the protocol, not all that much risk but no need to use it. Providing liquidity is not really like lending - you can withdraw at any time, though there are risks. But yeah, it isn't really lending in that sense"

People can transact on zkrollups and get 20k transactions per second and miniscule fees, and it rolls up onto mainnet ethereum with a zkproof of those transactions allowing it to inherit the L1 security (rather than current sidechains or other L1s having to compete with their own consensus mechanisms and economic security).   This rollup-centric shift came last year when we started to see just how good rollups can be: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698  Theres a bunch of different teams working on ZKL2s, some coming this summer! the hype is real! And after the merge onto Proof of Stake (targeting Q4) ethereum then overtakes bitcoin as the most economically secure chain(hardest to 51% attack), so there is great incentive to build on eth L2s: https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html  Some have a focus of zkproofs for scaling purposes only, and some are using them for privacy too, e.g. you can already send private eth transactions with https://zk.money  https://aztec.network/ https://zksync.io/ https://starkware.co/ https://loopring.org/ and more i cant think of off the top of my head."

1619216213.0,2021-04-23 18:16:53,0,5,Kraken allows you to stake as well as other sites. It is always worth it to stake if you plan to hold
1619217917.0,2021-04-23 18:45:17,0,6,If you stake on the eth 2.0 you can't unstake them.  You get them back when it gets online. It can be years. And you might find some other ways to stake your eth.   And if you staked on eth 2.0 you gotta wait for a long time to see those again.   I just found something . But I don't know if it's something yet. And won't recommend something i don't fully believe.  Be careful . And do your research. More than you think is needed. Becoming a liquidity provider/ yield farming .   IN NOT RECOMMENDING THIS.  It's maybe an option to look at before you put everything on eth 2  Or be safe and just stake then normally
1619216141.0,2021-04-23 18:15:41,2,8,The easiest way would be to just stake it on binance but ya know not your keys not your coins. It is definitely worth it to stake because it helps the system and earns you an APY on your ETH
1619216313.0,2021-04-23 18:18:33,2,3,How do we do a long term stake on our ETH? I've no problem locking it in for as long as it's needed.
1619216725.0,2021-04-23 18:25:25,0,3,Very interested in this exact question!
1619217041.0,2021-04-23 18:30:41,1,3,1) You don’t own the keys if they aren’t in your hard wallet.  I sleep better at night knowing that I own the keys to my crypto.  2) The tax implications of staking seem like a nightmare to be honest.  At least in the US
1619216138.0,2021-04-23 18:15:38,0,2,"If you're going to hold and not sell either way, then it's definitely worth it"
1619216173.0,2021-04-23 18:16:13,0,2,I bet the peeps over at r/ethstaker can help you out
1619216136.0,2021-04-23 18:15:36,3,2,Well the catch for ETH staking is that:  1.You need a minimum of 32 ETH.  2.You are locked in for I think about 6 months or so before you cant take it out
1619217113.0,2021-04-23 18:31:53,0,1,"Could be totally wrong I don't follow this stuff closely anymore. My understanding of staking is the only risk, besides how much you need to do it or how long you have until you can access it again, is that if the node you are staking on attempts to approve of invalid transactions or is otherwise a bad actor on the network then the staked coins can be penalized. Here's some info on it from a quick search: https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/rewards-and-penalties-on-ethereum-20-phase-0  This shouldn't be a risk if you are using standard software and good enough hardware for your validator to do its job."
1619217191.0,2021-04-23 18:33:11,1,1,you can wait for [rocketpool](https://www.rocketpool.net/) to come out. it's a decentralized solution with tokenized staking if you don't want to use an exchange and lock up your ETH
1619217627.0,2021-04-23 18:40:27,1,1,Best way is shared stake. 💯    You deposit your ETH into their platform and you can remove it or withdraw it at any time without penalties. You also get staking rewards from their governance token for doing this and you are never locked in to waiting until the transition. They also have liquidity pools with the veETH2 so you can earn rewards on their liquidity pools as well. It's my favorite ETH staking platform. Nothing else compares to it
1619218161.0,2021-04-23 18:49:21,0,1,Bancor!
1619218263.0,2021-04-23 18:51:03,0,1,"If you hodl anyway then definitely, find a platform that suits you and enjoy your passive income"
1619219570.0,2021-04-23 19:12:50,0,1,"If you stake in a pool, it's locked up until 2.0 launches. This is a long-term commitment with no certain endpoint.  Alternatively, you can earn interest on your holdings through CeFi or DeFi. You can pull it whenever you want."
1619220253.0,2021-04-23 19:24:13,0,1,Locking yourself in. Anything could happen you dont necessarily know you'll hold
1619222074.0,2021-04-23 19:54:34,0,1,i kind of realized that i can't keep my dirty hands off of flexible staked coins. trading them randomly.  so i came across many posts of people forgetting their coins. and suddenly they're worth massive amounts.  this is kind of my gift for the next bullrun. i can't unstake it. so i can't trade it.
1619232335.0,2021-04-23 22:45:35,0,1,Don't stake on binance .. use kraken.. if u have 32 and truly believe in eth then start ur own node
1619260105.0,2021-04-24 06:28:25,0,1,In germany there are tax implications when you stake. Idk about the US
1619280262.0,2021-04-24 12:04:22,0,1,"Just as a side note: don't disclose exact values you own, and especially where it is stored (binance). Someone can social engineer you and you might lose your coins. It is for your safety :)"
1619216262.0,2021-04-23 18:17:42,1,8,I stake it on Binance... who knows how it'll ultimately play out but I trust them to not pull shady shit and I dont gave enough ETH to do it another way
1619218149.0,2021-04-23 18:49:09,0,1,I'm interested in staking but not wanting to put a bunch of money an exchange. A tough conundrum.
1619218214.0,2021-04-23 18:50:14,1,2,Check out /r/ethstaker. They're super helpful and lots of discussion around pool staking options since not many have 32 ETH.
1619218409.0,2021-04-23 18:53:29,1,1,My understanding is can only stake on your own with a minimum of 32 ETH.  But many DeFi institutions like coinbase and binance are offering to stake less than the minimum for you in exchange for some of the interest.
1619218382.0,2021-04-23 18:53:02,1,3,">2) The tax implications of staking seem like a nightmare to be honest. At least in the US  It's not really that bad in terms of how complicated. You pay basic income tax on it the year you received it, at the fair market value when you received it.  Eventually when/if you sell It's just capital gains on the profits (cost basis would be the amount you already paid tax on)."
1619217248.0,2021-04-23 18:34:08,1,6,32 ETH is the requirement to operate a validator. You can stake with any amount.
1619216425.0,2021-04-23 18:20:25,1,2,I'm using Coinbase - you don't need 32 for that.
1619217104.0,2021-04-23 18:31:44,0,1,I like your username u/Lil_Spoops
1619217372.0,2021-04-23 18:36:12,0,1,"Pretty interesting. Although I am worried that if I get them out of the exchange before ETH 2.0 I'll have to pay a high transaction fee. Oh well, probably with the high staking rewards it will be worth it at the end. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll keep an eye on it!"
1619217769.0,2021-04-23 18:42:49,1,1,Wouldn’t depositing ETH to a platform means I don’t own the keys and hence coins?  Does ETH staking require sending coins to 3rd party pool?
1619217046.0,2021-04-23 18:30:46,1,1,"I'm in your shoes. How did you stake, did you convert to BETH, which is the wrapped vversion of ETH 2.0? I've heard that when you convert it's a 1.05 ratio. Not sure if it's recommended. But as you said, I don't have 32 ETH to spare lol"
1619218937.0,2021-04-23 19:02:17,0,1,Perfect I'll head over and do some research. Thank you!
1619218902.0,2021-04-23 19:01:42,0,4,Well Coinbase and Binance is as centralized as you get lol but i get what you mean.
1619218558.0,2021-04-23 18:55:58,1,2,I’m assuming most staking platforms have documents prepared for you at the end of the year?
1619254914.0,2021-04-24 05:01:54,0,1,for the validator or other staking platforms what are usually the % APY?
1619216835.0,2021-04-23 18:27:15,1,2,I’m still on the waiting list so I switched to Voyager’s 5% interest
1619217864.0,2021-04-23 18:44:24,0,0,That's my question too. Seems quite shady tbh
1619217183.0,2021-04-23 18:33:03,0,2,"I think BETH is a lot more volatile and I suspect Binance make it favourable to them in any conversion rate, but I figure that the staking return offsets that quite a bit and I'm not selling so.... why not?"
1619218922.0,2021-04-23 19:02:02,1,2,"Some do, some don't, but there are tax programs can apparently scrape your transactions and/or utilize a csv file to parse it for you if the platform doesn't do it for you.  Personally I'm keeping track in a spreadsheet manually (which sounds worse than it is) as a back up solution to give me an idea of how much I'll need to pay tax on.  My goal is to be as reasonably accurate as possible. I'm making quite a bit surprisingly each month due to staking 😅 so it'll be a bit more tax than I was expecting, but it's definitely worth it. I'm planning on 35% tax to be safe."

1619230957.0,2021-04-23 22:22:37,1,4,"Love both ETH and SOL and SOL will likely never catch ETH but let's be serious.   Anything to do with the SOL ecosystem is better, like it's not even close. Tx speeds and fees on anything ETH related are criminal.  I settle tx's on raydium.io in mere seconds for fractions of a penny meanwhile anything I do on Metamask, Uniswap,  Opensea etc costs a fortune and takes forever.   Take this for example, I exited an LP on Uniswap a few weeks ago, cost? Around $90usd and the tx took almost 30 minutes.   Every time I harvest the farm on raydium it takes under 10 seconds and costs $0.00007.  It will take me just over 1.2Million harvests on raydium.io to equal the tx fees of that one transaction I made on the ethereum chain.   I harvest once a week so the 1.2 million harvests would take just over 23,000 years to complete.   Let that settle in lol."

1619200487.0,2021-04-23 13:54:47,0,1,"Personally, I don't see the issue. However, I can definitely understand why some people have a problem with the current system. I can imagine that users with more Moons get a ton of scam/spam messages.  On most other crypto-based social media platforms (such as Steemit) account values are shown. Some accounts have values in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. I'm sure those people are being targeted for scams and such, however, I feel like those are quite easy to avoid. You can't really be scammed here unless you give away your password or recovery phrases (or send moons to another account yourself for whatever reason).  Hacks very rarely occur against specific accounts. That is to say, it's very rare for hacks to be against a single user. These days there are many methods to prevent such brute-force methods against a particular user/account. More often than not hacks occur at some level within the platform itself and result in the information of MANY accounts being stolen - something that hiding Moon counts won't prevent.  So while I do see other advantages to hiding Moon counts, I don't believe it will lead to a decrease in account hacks. However, it may make life for the wealthier Moon holders much more pleasant as they won't be targeted for scams as much."

Once those can get under control the price is going stupid because everything in the ETH ecosystem will no longer be held back by high fees.   To use an analogy, ETH currently is a NASCAR with a restrictor plate to hold back it's full potential. ETH 2.0 is an F1 car that goes so fast the paint peels off"

I would also recommend checking out VeChain, it's just a matter of time before it will see major adoption. It solves a ton of real world issues. Cosmos and Tezos are also worth looking at. Just make sure you do your own research and invest in tech you believe in. I'm personally bullish on all of those projects in the long.   I should also add that I'm waiting for the bear market to load up on those alts. I've been in the space awhile and this reminds me of the time leading up to the last crash. I believe Eth is a true game changer, so my strategy now is to take profits from alts and put them in Eth right now. Btc and eth tend to hold way better during crashes and dips. But this is all just like, my opinion man."

1619108732.0,2021-04-22 12:25:32,1,11,"I think it's actually unclear what a dropping BTC dominance means in this bull cycle. On one hand, it could be a signal of growing mania as people try to find 10x's on every altcoin in existence. On the other, you would expect a dropping BTC dominance in a maturing blockchain/crypto market.  The question is what do we know about the current macro conditions and how does that reflect in our current dropping BTC dominance. Personally, I think it's a bit of a mixed bag. With all the MSM attention on crypto recently, I would expect a lot of new people to pile in but have relatively weak hands. But we also know that institutional adoption is growing at an explosive pace which should have a significant moderating effect on overall volatility. On balance, I think it's likely that we will see an overextension of the market late this year or early next, followed by a substantial correction. However, I don't think there's sufficient reason to fear a 2017-like event for anything other than the most speculative coins."
1619106959.0,2021-04-22 11:55:59,1,17,"I don't think it should scare anyone. Honestly ETH sees so much more real-world use with so many tokens on the network that I don't think it's going anywhere.   Also, if you're a long-term holder there will be ups and downs, I bought ETH first back in 2017 so I've been through many. But both the ups and the downs are consistently moving higher all the time at a rate that vastly outpaces inflation and the stock market, so it's still a great investment with a lot of potential for future adoption."

Also the delta increase lowers every year due to the emission being fixed but the total supply grows. Next year it will be 3.9% and so on.

It’s the largest, most secure network on the planet and is the base layer for the new world money.   It’s monetary policy is better than any fiat currency in the world, and is the first implementation of actual scarcity.  There are coins that are faster and cheaper, but seriously lack the decentralized nature and security of the bitcoin network.   You understand that nodes are the ones who control the network right? Not Chinese mining farms, and also, those Chinese miners are pools of multiple parties, not just one centralized mining farm.   Ethereum has unlimited supply, and it’s blockchain has been reversed.  The Dao hack in 2016 showed us that the central control of ethereum allows a couple core devs to undue the transactions of the network, which goes against what a blockchain should be.  Eth also premined a bunch of tokens before the initial ICO and loaded the pockets of the inner circle.  Bitcoin is the most fair, honest, decentralized money in the world. The bull markets always bring out people saying that altcoins will flip bitcoin, which is unlikely to ever happen."

Utility on the blockchain is being built every day, and I don’t think that is anything but good, I just don’t see an alt season with low BTC dominance as a long-term bear sign for BTC, it seems to fit the cyclical nature we’re in where BTC will pull up the market, then stagger as value flows into alt currencies because of the market euphoria that comes from BTC doing just that.  I’m not anti-alt in the slightest though, they’re a valuable commodity and provide utility in the crypto-space, just think this movement in the market is a natural part of the cycle. People see BTC go up a few hundred percent and they start thinking ‘Wow, what if I bought early’, then start looking for the next BTC. Unfortunately why we see a lot of scams and rug pulls in these markets, because sharks figure they can make easy money if they can just convince new people that their piece of technology *is* the new BTC, which they inevitably do."

Because of this gas fees stay higher than they need to be.  With EIP-1559 this should be less of a problem and therefore the overall fees (basefee + tip) might be lower than the gas fees now.

That said, since then and especially since this recent bull run, I’ve been very happy with how it’s been performing.

1619115000.0,2021-04-22 14:10:00,0,1,Well i think the March 2020 crash may have prolonged this one. Some are saying the cycles are about 4 yrs. So if we surpass Dec 2021 & Jan 2022 then it's still hard to say if March prolonged it or if you're right about longer cycles. Q3 & Q4 will be important to keep a close eye on for sure.
1619115415.0,2021-04-22 14:16:55,0,1,No it is not. 2013 and 2017 both spiked in Dec. So it would December of 2021. You can look at charts for this. ETH however was an alt coin then and spiked afterwards in Jan of 2018. So Dec/Jan would be based on previous cycles.

1619108776.0,2021-04-22 12:26:16,1,5,"No worries! Inflation measures prices, monetary supply measures the amount of a currency that's available to the public (at least the BASE monetary supply: M0).  So if the prices of bananas were $5 last year, and they are $6 this year, there was an inflation of 20% in bananas.  If 1000 dollars existed last year, and this year there's 1200 dollars (cause someone printed 200) then there's been a 20% increase in the base monetary supply.  Those two are usually linked somehow, but they are not the same thing. My point is: if you increase the amount of doge that exists, you're changing it's monetary supply, you're not changing inflation (directly, because those two are usually linked).  To put it into perspective, US inflation in USD was less than 2% in 2020, while USD's M1's increase was higher than **35%**. Doge's **~4%** is a fucking joke compared to that.

So yeah, there is a space for ETH for sure, I wasn’t trying to undermine it at all and hope my earlier comments didn’t come across as such."

1619177631.0,2021-04-23 07:33:51,2,1,"didnt i just congratulate you for your success if you werent pretending? sounds like the pretending part really hit a nerve. i wonder why :D   fyi ""suck it"" is what id expect from an insecure developmentally disabled child, not someone raking in thousands with their market insight. YOU gave yourself away bud."

I hope ETH hits 20k during this run, don’t get me wrong, but I’m not holding my breath"
